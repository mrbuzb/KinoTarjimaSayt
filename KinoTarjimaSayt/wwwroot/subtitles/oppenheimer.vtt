1
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,739
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,942
Dr. Oppenheimer.

3
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:25,878
As we begin, I believe you have

4
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:27,913
a statement to read
into the record.

5
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:30,950
Yes, Your Honor.

6
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:33,086
We're not judges, Doctor.

7
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,154
No.

8
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:36,655
Of course.

9
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:44,797
Members of the security board,

10
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,134
the so-called
derogatory information

11
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:50,070
in your indictment of me
cannot be fairly understood,

12
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:53,939
except in the context
of my life and my work.

13
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,144
How long did he testify?

14
00:01:57,177 --> 00:01:58,911
Honestly, I forget.

15
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:02,282
The whole hearing took a month.

16
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:03,749
An ordeal, hmm?

17
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:05,452
Well, I've only
read the transcripts.

18
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,755
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

19
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:11,023
You weren't there?

20
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:13,360
As chairman,
I wasn't allowed to be.

21
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:15,961
Are they really
going to ask about it?

22
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:18,098
-It was years ago.
-Four years ago...

23
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,166
Five.

24
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,767
Oppenheimer
still divides America.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,171
The committee is gonna want
to know where you stood.

26
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:26,306
Senator Thurmond asked me to say

27
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:28,175
not to feel that
you're on trial.

28
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,744
Oh, funny, I didn't
till you just said that.

29
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,380
-Really, Mr. Strauss...
-It's Admiral.

30
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:36,349
Um, Admiral Strauss.
This is a formality.

31
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:38,884
President Eisenhower has asked
you to be in his cabinet.

32
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,786
Senate really has no choice
but to confirm you.

33
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:43,056
And if they bring up
Oppenheimer?

34
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:45,458
When they bring up Oppenheimer,
you answer honestly.

35
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:47,893
No senator can deny
you did your duty.

36
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:50,063
It'll be uncomfortable.

37
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:52,232
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

38
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,872
Why did you leave
the United States?

39
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,378
I, uh... I wanted to study
the new physics.

40
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:06,946
Was there nowhere here?

41
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,981
I thought Berkeley
had the leading

42
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,849
theoretical physics department.

43
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:13,453
Yes. Once I built it.

44
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,088
But first I had to go to Europe.

45
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:18,491
I went to Cambridge to study
under Patrick Blackett.

46
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:21,127
Were you happier there
than in America?

47
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,296
-Happier?
-Yes.

48
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:30,270
No. No, I, uh...

49
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:35,108
<i>I was homesick, um...</i>

50
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:37,943
...emotionally immature...

51
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:44,251
<i>...troubled by visions</i>
<i>of a hidden universe.</i>

52
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:57,130
Useless in the lab.

53
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:04,271
Christ, Oppenheimer.

54
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:06,373
Have you had any sleep?

55
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,409
Start again.

56
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:11,944
I need to go
to the lecture, sir.

57
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,380
Why?

58
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:15,315
It's Niels Bohr.

59
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:19,818
Damn, completely forgot.

60
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:22,055
All right.
Let's go.

61
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:26,293
Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.

62
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:27,427
You finish coating those plates.

63
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,296
You see them?

64
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:36,835
Don't forget to clean up!

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,937
<i>Quantum physics</i>
<i>is not a step forward,</i>

66
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,475
it is a new way
to understand reality.

67
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:19,079
Einstein's opened the door,
now we are peering through,

68
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:22,014
seeing a world inside our world.

69
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:27,454
A world of energy and paradox
that not everyone can accept.

70
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:10,996
Yeah, definitely.

71
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,399
Are you all right?

72
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,468
Niels, meet
J. Robert Oppenheimer.

73
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:17,002
What's the "J" stand for?

74
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:19,004
Nothing, apparently.

75
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,140
You were at my lecture.

76
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,574
You asked
the only good question.

77
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,343
No one's denying his insight.

78
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,445
It's his laboratory work that
leaves a little to be desired.

79
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:27,313
I heard
you give the same lecture...

80
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:30,550
At Harvard, yes, and you
asked the same question.

81
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,684
Why ask again?

82
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:33,319
Hadn't liked your answer.

83
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,423
Did you like it better
yesterday?

84
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:37,724
A lot.

85
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:39,659
You can lift the stone
without being ready

86
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,061
for the snake that's revealed.

87
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:44,230
Now it seems you're ready.

88
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:46,566
But you don't enjoy the lab?

89
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,469
So get out of Cambridge
with its beakers and potions.

90
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:52,472
Go somewhere they let you think.

91
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:55,108
Where?

92
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,743
Göttingen.

93
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:58,711
-Born?
-Born.

94
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:00,713
Get to Germany,
study under Max Born.

95
00:07:00,747 --> 00:07:03,383
Learn the ways of theory.

96
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,451
I'll send word.

97
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:08,188
Wormhole.

98
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:09,589
How's your mathematics?

99
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:11,591
Not good enough for
the physicist he wants to be.

100
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:14,194
Algebra's like sheet music.

101
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:16,696
The important thing isn't
"Can you read music?"

102
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:17,730
It's "Can you hear it?"

103
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:21,067
Can you hear the music, Robert?

104
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,603
Yes, I can.

105
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:00,833
The senator from Wyoming.

106
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:04,270
Admiral Strauss, I'm interested
in your relationship

107
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:07,173
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

108
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:08,808
You met him in 1947?

109
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:09,809
Correct.

110
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,611
You were commissioner

111
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:13,212
of the Atomic Energy Commission?

112
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:17,183
I was, but I-I actually
met Robert in my capacity

113
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:19,886
as board member of the
Institute for Advanced Study

114
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,721
at Princeton because

115
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:24,390
after the war,
he was world-renowned

116
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,826
as the great man of physics,
and I was determined

117
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,562
to get him to run the Institute.

118
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:41,808
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

119
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:43,176
Mr. Strauss.

120
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,510
It's pronounced "straws."

121
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:46,879
Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer.

122
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:48,781
Whatever way you say it,
they know I'm Jewish.

123
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:52,919
I'm president of Temple Emanu-El
in Manhattan.

124
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:55,221
"Straws" is just
the Southern pronunciation.

125
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:56,289
-Ah.
-Anyway,

126
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:57,757
welcome to the Institute.

127
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,425
I think you could be
very happy here.

128
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,394
Yes, well,
you'll love the commute.

129
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:02,762
The position comes
with that house

130
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:04,263
for you and your wife

131
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:06,466
and your, is it two children?

132
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:07,300
Yes, two.

133
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,269
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

134
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,505
And you're a physicist
by training, Mr. Strauss?

135
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:14,607
I'm sorry, uh,
common room 4:00 tea.

136
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:17,410
No, I'm not trained in physics
or anything else.

137
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,278
-I'm a self-made man.
-Ah.

138
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:21,314
-I can relate to that.
-Really?

139
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:23,683
Yes, my father was one.

140
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:27,286
And this would be your office.

141
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,398
I'm told he's there
most afternoons.

142
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,533
You know, I've always wondered

143
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:44,170
why you didn't involve him
in the Manhattan Project.

144
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:48,441
Greatest scientific mind
of our time.

145
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:50,343
Of his time.

146
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:52,412
Einstein published
his Theory of Relativity

147
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:55,381
more than 40 years ago now.

148
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,885
But never embraced
the quantum world it revealed.

149
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:00,453
"God doesn't play dice."

150
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,455
Precisely.

151
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:05,291
You never thought of studying
physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

152
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:07,694
Well, I had offers,
but I chose to sell shoes.

153
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:11,230
Lewis Strauss was once
a lowly shoe salesman.

154
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:13,900
No, just a shoe salesman.

155
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:16,202
Huh.

156
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,239
-I'd love to introduce you.
-No need.

157
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,809
I have known him for years.

158
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,732
Albert.

159
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:54,540
What was that?
What did you say to him?

160
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:57,710
Oh, he's fine.

161
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,882
Mr. Strauss,
there are things in my past

162
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:04,417
you ought to be aware of.

163
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,352
Well, as chairman of the AEC,

164
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:07,854
I have access
to your security file.

165
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:08,888
I've read it.

166
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,490
-You're not worried?
-No.

167
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:11,891
Why would I be worried
after everything

168
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:13,392
you've done for your country?

169
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:14,894
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

170
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:16,763
Well, the purpose
of this institute

171
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:19,465
is to provide a haven
for independent minds.

172
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,402
That's you.
You are the man for the job.

173
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:26,039
Well, then I'll consider it.

174
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,341
I'll see you
at the AEC meeting tomorrow.

175
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:34,313
This is one
of the most prestigious

176
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:36,083
appointments in the country.

177
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:38,317
Yes, with a great commute.

178
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:40,653
That's why I'm considering it.

179
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,455
<i>So, Dr. Oppenheimer brought</i>

180
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:44,891
<i>your attention</i>
<i>to his past associations</i>

181
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:46,059
<i>before you appointed him?</i>

182
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,527
Yes.

183
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,395
And it didn't concern you?

184
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:50,963
Just then,
I was entirely consumed

185
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:54,767
with what he must have said
to Einstein to sour him on me.

186
00:12:58,371 --> 00:12:59,572
But later?

187
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:01,541
Well, we all know
what happened later.

188
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,943
Doctor, your, uh...
your time in Europe,

189
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:05,545
you seemed to meet
with a wide range

190
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,013
of other countries' physicists.

191
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,048
Yes, that's right.

192
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:10,349
Any Russians?

193
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,852
None that spring to mind.

194
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:15,788
If you'll just allow me to
continue with my statement...

195
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:18,791
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample
opportunity to cross-examine.

196
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:23,963
After Göttingen,
I moved on to Leiden in Holland

197
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:27,034
<i>where I first met Isidor Rabi.</i>

198
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,569
Excuse me.

199
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:35,842
A Yank,
lecturing on the new physics?

200
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,943
This I have to hear.

201
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:39,011
I'm an American myself.

202
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:40,546
How surprising.

203
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,647
Um...

204
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,950
Let me know if you need
any help with the English.

205
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,899
Wait, what's he saying?

206
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:11,477
No, thank you.

207
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,479
It's a long way to Zurich.

208
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:15,148
You get any skinnier,
we're gonna lose you

209
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:17,016
between the seat cushions.

210
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,085
I'm Rabi.

211
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:19,485
Oppenheimer.

212
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:21,554
I caught your lecture
on molecules.

213
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:22,722
Caught some of it.

214
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:26,025
We're a couple of New York Jews.
How do you know Dutch?

215
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:27,627
Well, I thought
I'd better learn it

216
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,828
when I got here this semester.

217
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,463
You learned enough Dutch
in six weeks

218
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,199
to give a lecture
on quantum mechanics?

219
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:33,733
Wanted to challenge myself.

220
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:36,136
Quantum physics wasn't
challenging enough.

221
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,904
<i>-Schvitzer.</i>
<i>-Schvitzer?</i>

222
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:39,839
Show-off.

223
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:41,707
Dutch in six weeks,
but you never learned Yiddish?

224
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:43,809
They don't speak it so much
my side of the park.

225
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:44,911
Screw you.

226
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:47,513
You homesick?

227
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:48,948
Oh, you know it.

228
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,919
Ever get the feeling our kind
isn't entirely welcome here?

229
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,020
Physicists?

230
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:55,554
'S funny.

231
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,657
Not in the department.

232
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,991
They're all Jewish too.

233
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:02,495
Eat.

234
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:06,933
There's a German
you have to seek out.

235
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:10,503
-Heisenberg.
-Right.

236
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,181
One might be led
to the presumption

237
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:23,683
that behind the quantum world,

238
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:27,586
there still hides a real world
in which causality holds,

239
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,822
but such speculation seem to us,

240
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:32,591
to say it explicitly, fruitless.
Thank you.

241
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,061
Have a great day.

242
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:40,967
-Wonderful.
-Thank you.

243
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,235
Dr. Oppenheimer.

244
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,204
Oppenheimer, yes.

245
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,106
I liked your paper on molecules.

246
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,640
Probably because
you inspired it.

247
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:49,176
If I inspire anything else,
let me know.

248
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,243
We could publish together.

249
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:52,112
I have to get back to America.

250
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:53,879
Why? There's no one there

251
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:56,116
taking quantum mechanics
seriously.

252
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,750
That's exactly why.

253
00:15:57,783 --> 00:16:00,220
He's pining for the canyons
of Manhattan.

254
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:02,688
Canyons of New Mexico.

255
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:03,856
-You're from New Mexico?
-No.

256
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:05,992
New York, but my brother
and I have a ranch

257
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:08,128
outside Santa Fe.

258
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:10,529
That's the America
I miss right now.

259
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:12,631
Then it's best you get home,
cowboys.

260
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:14,267
That's him.

261
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:17,737
No, me and horses.
I don't think so.

262
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,905
Nice to meet you.

263
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,776
Did you ever encounter
Heisenberg again?

264
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:26,712
Not in person, no, but, uh...

265
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:30,050
...you might say
our paths crossed.

266
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,819
On returning to America,
I accepted positions

267
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:36,589
at both Caltech
and up at Berkeley.

268
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:41,927
I got it, it's all right.

269
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,681
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

270
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:05,318
You must be Oppenheimer.

271
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:06,886
Yes.

272
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,256
I hear you want to start
a school of quantum theory.

273
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,956
I am starting it. Next door.

274
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,825
-They put you in there?
-I asked for it.

275
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,927
Wanted to be close
to you experimentalists.

276
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,330
Theory will get you
only so far, huh?

277
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:19,332
We're building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

278
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:22,069
-Magnificent.
-Would you like to help?

279
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:23,936
Build it? Oh, no.

280
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:25,072
No, no.

281
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:27,673
But I am working on theories
I'd like to test with it.

282
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:28,707
When do you start teaching?

283
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,609
I've got my first in an hour.

284
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,645
-Seminar?
-Pupil.

285
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,915
One student? That's it?

286
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:38,684
I'm teaching something
no one here has dreamt of.

287
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:40,719
But once people start hearing
what you can do with it...

288
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:42,222
There's no going back.

289
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,692
-Oh. I must have missed the...
-Ah. Lo...

290
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,727
-Mr. Lomanitz?
-Na.

291
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:50,830
Yeah.

292
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,965
Yes, this is it. Please.

293
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:54,067
Take a seat.

294
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:00,739
What do you know
about quantum mechanics?

295
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:03,143
I have a grasp on the basics.

296
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:04,743
Then you're doing it wrong.

297
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:08,248
Is light made up
of particles or waves?

298
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:09,416
Quantum mechanics
says it's both.

299
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:11,051
How could it be both?

300
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:12,985
-It can't.
-It can't.

301
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:17,890
But it is. It's paradoxical,
and yet, it works.

302
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:26,032
Now.

303
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,869
Thank you.

304
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,905
Mr. Lomanitz.
You're gonna be okay.

305
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:34,307
Mr. Snyder.

306
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:35,875
Now let's consider a star.

307
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:39,446
A star. A vast furnace
burning in outer space,

308
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:42,882
fire pushing outwards
against its own gravity.

309
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,351
Balanced.

310
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:46,685
But if that furnace cools...

311
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:50,056
...and gravity starts winning,
it contracts.

312
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:52,024
Density increases.

313
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:53,260
Correct.

314
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:54,461
Increasing gravity.

315
00:18:54,494 --> 00:18:55,995
Increasing density.

316
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,165
-And?
-It's a vicious cycle until...

317
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:59,832
what's the limit here?

318
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,236
I don't know.
See where the math takes us.

319
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,038
I guarantee it's somewhere
no one's been before.

320
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:06,972
Me?

321
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:09,176
Yes, you.
Your math is better than mine.

322
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,012
<i>Dr. Oppenheimer's file</i>

323
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:15,448
<i>contained detail</i>
<i>of his activities in Berkeley.</i>

324
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:16,949
Why would they have
started a file

325
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:19,919
on Dr. Oppenheimer
before the war?

326
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:22,422
Well, you'd have
to ask Mr. Hoover.

327
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:24,324
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

328
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:27,294
Uh, my assumption is that

329
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:30,463
it was connected to his, uh,

330
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:33,033
left-wing political activities.

331
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:35,801
You shouldn't
let them bring up politics

332
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:37,170
in the classroom, Oppie.

333
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:38,938
I wrote that.

334
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:42,242
Lawrence, you embrace
the revolution in physics.

335
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:44,077
Can't you see it
everywhere else?

336
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,213
Picasso, Stravinsky,
Freud, Marx.

337
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:47,846
Well, this is America, Oppie.

338
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,249
We had our revolution.

339
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:52,885
Seriously,
keep it out of the lab.

340
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:56,021
Well, out of the lab,
my landlady

341
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:58,857
is having a discussion group
tonight. Interested?

342
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,960
I have sampled
the Berkeley political scene.

343
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:03,029
It's all just
philosophy post-grads

344
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:05,365
and Communists
talking integration.

345
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:07,067
You don't care
about integration.

346
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,968
I want to vote for it,
not talk about it.

347
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,003
'Specially on a Friday.
Come on, let's eat.

348
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:13,373
I'm meeting my brother there.

349
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:15,275
<i>And how would these activities</i>

350
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:16,443
<i>have come to the attention</i>

351
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,477
of the FBI?

352
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,479
Well, if I remember correctly,

353
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:21,448
the FBI was taking
license plates

354
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,816
outside suspected
Communist gatherings,

355
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,851
<i>and his name popped up.</i>

356
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:34,960
-Gotcha!
-Jesus Christ.

357
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:37,297
-Sorry. Hi, brother.
-Frank.

358
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:40,033
Uh, you remember Jackie.

359
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,534
Evening.

360
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:43,536
Let's go. Come.

361
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,139
Right over there,
right over there.

362
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:50,076
Robert. I want you
to meet Chevalier.

363
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,812
Dr. Haakon Chevalier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

364
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:55,014
-Pleasure.
-Pleasure.

365
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:56,349
This is my little brother,
Frank.

366
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:57,584
-And this is...
-Hello.

367
00:20:57,617 --> 00:20:59,552
-Still Jackie.
-Hello, Still Jackie.

368
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:01,554
Chevalier, you're in languages?

369
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:03,323
And your reputation
precedes you.

370
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:05,091
-What have you heard?
-Excuse me.

371
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,892
That you're teaching a radical
new approach to physics

372
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:08,161
I have no chance
of understanding,

373
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:09,562
but I hadn't heard
you're a Party member.

374
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:11,897
-Uh, I'm not.
-Oh, not yet.

375
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,899
Frank and I are thinking of
joining. Just the other day,

376
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,568
-I was saying...
-I support a range of causes.

377
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:17,237
The Spanish Civil War?

378
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,004
A democratic republic
being overthrown

379
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,340
by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

380
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:22,042
Our government.

381
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:23,543
They think that socialism is
a bigger threat than fascism.

382
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,078
Not for long.

383
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:26,912
Look at what the Nazis
are doing to the Jews.

384
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:29,516
I send funds to colleagues
in Germany to emigrate.

385
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,584
I have to do something.

386
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:34,987
My own work is so abstract.

387
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,589
What are you working on?

388
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:38,558
What happens to the stars
when they die.

389
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:40,025
Do stars die?

390
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:42,529
Well, if they do,

391
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,464
they'd cool, then collapse.

392
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:47,133
In fact, the bigger the star,

393
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,868
<i>the more violent its demise.</i>

394
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:51,438
The gravity gets so concentrated

395
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:54,441
it swallows everything.

396
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:55,442
Everything, even light.

397
00:21:55,475 --> 00:21:56,643
Can that really happen?

398
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:58,478
The math says it can.

399
00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:59,945
If we can get published,

400
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:01,548
then perhaps one day,
an astronomer finds one.

401
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,316
But right now,
all I have is theory,

402
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,218
which can't impact
people's lives.

403
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:07,520
Well, if you're going
to send money to Spain,

404
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:09,122
do it through
the Communist Party.

405
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:10,490
They can get it
to the front lines.

406
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:12,925
Mary sent me with these.

407
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:16,429
-I'm Jean.
-Robert.

408
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:17,963
Haakon Chevalier.

409
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:19,532
The union meeting at Serber's
last month?

410
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:20,966
Right, right, yes.

411
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:22,369
Oh, thank you.

412
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:24,637
Robert here says
he's not a Communist.

413
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:26,972
Well, then he doesn't know
enough about it.

414
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:29,376
Oh, I've read <i>Das Kapital,</i>
all three volumes.

415
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:31,044
Does that count?

416
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:33,046
It would make you better read
than most party members.

417
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,382
Turgid stuff.
There's some thinking, um,

418
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:36,583
"Ownership is theft."

419
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,518
-"Property."
-"Property"?

420
00:22:38,551 --> 00:22:40,353
"Property," not "ownership."

421
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:42,422
I'm sorry, I read it
in the original German.

422
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:45,125
Well.

423
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,360
It's not about the book.

424
00:22:47,394 --> 00:22:50,397
It's about the ideas.
And you sound uncommitted.

425
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,065
Well, I'm committed
to thinking freely

426
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:54,534
about how to improve our world.

427
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:56,669
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

428
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:59,672
You're a physicist,
you pick and choose rules?

429
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:01,274
Or do you use the discipline

430
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:03,443
to channel your energies
into progress?

431
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:05,879
I like a little wiggle room.

432
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:09,182
Do you always
tow the party line?

433
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,318
I like my wiggle room too.

434
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:24,997
What?

435
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:26,199
Wait, wait, wait.

436
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:31,704
Unexpected.

437
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:33,640
-What?
-For a physicist.

438
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:36,443
You only have a shelf
full of Freud?

439
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:39,345
Well, actually,
my background's more...

440
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:41,214
Uh, Jungian?

441
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:43,450
You know analysis?

442
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:46,018
When I was in post-grad
at Cambridge,

443
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:47,353
I had a little trouble.

444
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:51,090
-I'll bite.
-I tried to poison my tutor.

445
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:52,125
Did you hate him?

446
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:53,626
I liked him very much.

447
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,562
You just needed to get laid.

448
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:57,163
Took my analyst two years,

449
00:23:57,197 --> 00:23:59,132
and I don't think they
ever put it that succinctly.

450
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,500
You have everyone convinced

451
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:03,269
you're more complicated
than you actually are.

452
00:24:03,303 --> 00:24:05,305
We're all simple souls, I guess.

453
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:06,506
I'm not.

454
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,410
What's this?

455
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:12,010
Sanskrit.

456
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,346
You can read this?

457
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:15,181
I'm learning.

458
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:21,187
Read this.

459
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,257
Well, in this part,

460
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,493
Vishnu reveals
his multi-armed self...

461
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:27,527
No.

462
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:30,463
Read the words.

463
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:37,002
"And now I am become Death.

464
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:44,177
Destroyer of worlds."

465
00:25:15,108 --> 00:25:16,442
This'll do.

466
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:24,183
It'll break before dawn.

467
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:27,587
Air cools overnight,
just before dawn, it breaks.

468
00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:32,191
Come.

469
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:41,701
Ah. So, I'm getting married.

470
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,336
-Frank. Congratulations!
-Thank you.

471
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,171
-Thank you.
-To Jackie?

472
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:47,574
Yeah, to Jackie.

473
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:48,708
The waitress.

474
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:50,710
Oppie, you're right.
It's lettin' up.

475
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:53,179
I'm gonna go see
if there's any stars.

476
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,248
All your talk
about the common man,

477
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:56,783
but Jackie's not good enough
for you, hmm?

478
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:57,850
Mm-mm.

479
00:25:57,884 --> 00:25:59,385
We join the Party and you can't

480
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:01,187
-hide your disapproval. Why?
-Oh, now, I...

481
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,288
Is that because that's
supposed to be your thing?

482
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:03,856
I haven't joined
the Party, Frank.

483
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,426
And I don't think she should
have convinced you to either.

484
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,194
Half of the faculty
is Communist.

485
00:26:08,227 --> 00:26:09,295
Not that half.

486
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,366
I'm your brother, Frank,
and I want you to be cautious.

487
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:15,101
And I want to wring your neck.

488
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:20,406
I won't live my life
afraid to make a mistake.

489
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:25,612
You're happy, I'm happy.

490
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,180
So then I'm happy you're happy

491
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:28,548
that I'm happy.

492
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:34,420
I feel like I could see

493
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:36,556
one of those dark stars
that you're working on.

494
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:39,158
You can't.
That's the whole point.

495
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:41,527
Their gravity swallows light.

496
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:45,865
It's like a kind of
hole in space.

497
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,233
Is Frank okay?

498
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:49,669
Yes. He just has
a shitty brother.

499
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:52,472
It is special here.

500
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:57,310
When I was a kid,

501
00:26:57,343 --> 00:27:00,380
I thought if I could find a way

502
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:04,784
to combine physics
and New Mexico,

503
00:27:04,817 --> 00:27:07,353
my life would be perfect.

504
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:09,689
Little remote for that.

505
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:10,857
Yes.

506
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,558
Let's get some sleep.

507
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:14,927
That mesa we saw today,

508
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:17,463
one of my favorite places
in the world.

509
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:19,766
And tomorrow we'll climb it.

510
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,234
What's it called?

511
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:24,337
Los Alamos.

512
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,442
I didn't expect
to see you today.

513
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,445
Do I have to make
an appointment?

514
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,516
Hey! Hey, get back here!

515
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:37,684
Alvarez?

516
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:46,292
Oppie! Oppie!

517
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:48,327
What? What is it?

518
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:49,962
They've done it.
They've done it.

519
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:51,264
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.

520
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:53,466
They split the uranium nucleus.

521
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,202
How?

522
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,838
Bombard it with neutrons.

523
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:00,006
It's a nuclear fission.

524
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,674
They did it,
they split the atom.

525
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,276
It's not possible.

526
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:11,217
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

527
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:19,792
See? Can't be done.

528
00:28:20,893 --> 00:28:24,297
Very elegant. Quite clear.

529
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,966
-There's just one problem.
-Where?

530
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,801
Next door.

531
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:30,770
Alvarez did it.

532
00:28:30,803 --> 00:28:32,939
But then look...

533
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:36,309
...these fission pulses,
they're massive.

534
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:39,612
I've seen 30 of these
in the past ten minutes.

535
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:42,482
Theory will take you
only so far.

536
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:45,985
During the process...

537
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:47,754
extra neutrons boil off,

538
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:50,957
which could be used to split
other uranium atoms.

539
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,391
Chain reaction.

540
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:54,061
You're thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'.

541
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:56,863
You, me, and every other
physicist around the world

542
00:28:56,896 --> 00:28:58,397
who's seen the news.

543
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:00,900
I'm... what?
What are we all thinking?

544
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:04,704
A bomb, Alvarez.

545
00:29:05,872 --> 00:29:07,573
A bomb.

546
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:10,810
I told you, Robert,
no more fucking flowers.

547
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:13,946
I don't understand
what you want from me.

548
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,748
I don't want anything from you.

549
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:18,785
Well, you say that
and then you call.

550
00:29:18,818 --> 00:29:21,420
Well, don't answer.

551
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:23,456
I'll always answer.

552
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:29,662
Fine.

553
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:32,398
Just no more flowers.

554
00:29:33,432 --> 00:29:34,801
You're not coming?

555
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:38,771
You have to know
when you're beaten, Robert.

556
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:42,809
It's not that simple, Hoke.

557
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:45,011
Chevalier,
good to see you. It's...

558
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:46,379
Ah, Barbara, good to see you

559
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:48,881
and the illustrious
Dr. Oppenheimer.

560
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:50,083
I'm Eltenton.

561
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:51,484
-Oh, pleasure.
-Please, please.

562
00:29:51,517 --> 00:29:52,685
Now, might you say a word

563
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:55,454
about organized labor
on campuses, yes?

564
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:57,023
Coming through! Coming through!

565
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:58,624
-F.A.E.C.T.!
-I work at Shell.

566
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:00,660
We've signed up chemists,
we've signed up engineers,

567
00:30:00,693 --> 00:30:02,562
so why not scientists
in academia?

568
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:05,498
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

569
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:08,801
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

570
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:10,469
Oppie! Oppie!

571
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:13,406
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

572
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:20,546
Teachers are unionized.
Why not professors?

573
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,014
Don't you have somewhere to be?

574
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:23,883
Lawrence,
academics have rights too.

575
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:26,419
Look, it's not that.
I've got a group coming.

576
00:30:26,452 --> 00:30:29,655
-Well, I'll sit in.
-Not this one.

577
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,597
Richard. Dr. Bush.

578
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,699
What brings you two up north?

579
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:50,543
Richard, you tell Ruth

580
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:51,844
I'll be down
to Pasadena Thursday.

581
00:31:00,853 --> 00:31:03,489
Your paper
on black holes is in!

582
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:05,491
Oppie!

583
00:31:05,524 --> 00:31:09,162
Where's Hartland?
Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

584
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:11,464
September 1st, 1939,

585
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:13,733
the world's gonna
remember this day.

586
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,136
Oh, Hartland.
Our paper, it's in print.

587
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:18,905
You've been upstaged.

588
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:25,045
During the Battle of Britain,
I found myself

589
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:27,813
increasingly out of sympathy
with the

590
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:30,850
policy of neutrality
that Communists advocated.

591
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:34,687
Right after Hitler invaded
Russia and we became allies,

592
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,756
these Communist sympathies,
did they return?

593
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:37,823
No.

594
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:42,561
I need to make clear that
my changing views on Russia

595
00:31:42,595 --> 00:31:43,829
did not mean a sharp break

596
00:31:43,863 --> 00:31:45,932
from those who held
different views.

597
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:48,534
For a year or two,
and during a previous marriage,

598
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:51,871
my wife Kitty had been
a Communist Party member.

599
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:55,841
Oop!

600
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,677
This way. This is where
I keep the good stuff.

601
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,712
Well, I thought
this was the Tolmans' house.

602
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:01,948
I live with them
while I'm at Caltech.

603
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:03,482
Do you two need anything?

604
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:04,984
We're good, Ruthie.

605
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:08,721
So, you're a biologist.

606
00:32:08,754 --> 00:32:11,958
Well, somehow
I have graduated to housewife.

607
00:32:11,991 --> 00:32:15,128
Can you explain
quantum mechanics to me?

608
00:32:15,162 --> 00:32:16,196
Seems baffling.

609
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:17,930
Yes, it is.

610
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,834
Well, this glass,

611
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:22,768
this drink...

612
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:25,905
...this countertop,

613
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:29,042
uh, our bodies...

614
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:30,977
all of it.

615
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,579
It's mostly empty space.

616
00:32:33,612 --> 00:32:36,116
Groupings of tiny energy waves
bound together.

617
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:38,017
By what?

618
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:41,620
Forces of attraction
strong enough to convince us

619
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:43,856
that matter is solid.

620
00:32:43,889 --> 00:32:47,026
Stop my body
passing through yours.

621
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:00,273
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

622
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:02,042
Not very.

623
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:07,780
There is someone that I feel...

624
00:33:07,813 --> 00:33:09,249
Does she feel the same way?

625
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:13,120
Sometimes. Not enough.

626
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:17,290
You know,
I'm going to New Mexico.

627
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,126
To my ranch, with friends.

628
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:20,526
You should come.

629
00:33:21,328 --> 00:33:23,163
I meant with your husband.

630
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:24,764
Yes, you did.

631
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:27,700
'Cause you know it won't make
a bit of difference.

632
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,173
Why did you marry him?

633
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:36,742
I was lost and he was kind.

634
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:39,779
Lost?

635
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:43,316
Well, my previous husband
had died, and...

636
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,785
at 28, I wasn't really ready
to be a widow.

637
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:47,820
-Who was your first husband?
-Nobody.

638
00:33:47,853 --> 00:33:50,323
But my second husband
was Joe Dallet.

639
00:33:50,357 --> 00:33:53,326
He was, um, from money,
like me, but...

640
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,296
he was a union organizer
in Youngstown, Ohio.

641
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:57,596
Fell hard.

642
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,898
How hard?

643
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:00,599
Hard enough to spend
the next four years

644
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:01,967
living off beans and pancakes,

645
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:04,770
handing out the <i>Daily Worker</i>
at factory gates.

646
00:34:04,804 --> 00:34:07,307
By 36, I just told Joe
I couldn't take it anymore.

647
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,209
Quit the Party and a year later,

648
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:12,778
I wanted him back, so...
Him, not the <i>Daily Worker.</i>

649
00:34:12,812 --> 00:34:14,947
And he said, "Swell, I'll meet
you on my way to Spain."

650
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,682
He went to fight
for the Loyalists?

651
00:34:16,715 --> 00:34:18,818
And then he went to
the brigades and I waited.

652
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:19,919
And...

653
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:22,155
Joe got himself killed

654
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:24,590
first time he popped his head
out of the trench.

655
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:28,361
Ideology got Joe killed.
For nothing.

656
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:30,263
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

657
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:31,398
My husband offered
both our futures

658
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:32,898
to stop one fascist bullet

659
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:35,102
from embedding itself
in a mudbank.

660
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:37,837
That's the definition
of nothing.

661
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,872
Seems a little reductive.

662
00:34:39,905 --> 00:34:41,640
Pragmatic.

663
00:34:41,674 --> 00:34:44,111
Now here I am.

664
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:47,947
Wherever the hell this is.

665
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:58,258
I didn't want you to hear it
from anyone else.

666
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:04,030
Least you didn't
bring me flowers.

667
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:12,738
We both know I'm not
what you want, Jean.

668
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:16,409
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

669
00:35:16,443 --> 00:35:17,843
No.

670
00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:21,780
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

671
00:35:22,982 --> 00:35:24,717
You knocked her up, fast work.

672
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,387
Can't keep a good man down.

673
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,422
I meant her.

674
00:35:29,456 --> 00:35:31,458
She knew what she wanted.

675
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:33,426
What about the husband?

676
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,927
We talked, um,

677
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,896
they're getting a divorce, so...

678
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:40,699
we can get married
before she starts showing.

679
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:42,202
How civilized.

680
00:35:44,171 --> 00:35:45,272
You idiot.

681
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:47,073
This is your community.

682
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:50,043
You think the rules
don't apply to the golden boy?

683
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:52,845
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

684
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:55,382
Don't alienate the only people
in the world

685
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:57,083
that understand what you do.

686
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:00,187
One day you might need them.

687
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,955
F.A.E.C.T.!

688
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:04,191
The Federation of Architects,

689
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,360
Engineers, Chemists
and Technicians.

690
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:16,336
Lomanitz,
what do you get paid a month?

691
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:17,504
That's not the point, Lawrence.

692
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,838
What do any of you
have in common

693
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:22,475
with farm laborers
and dock workers?

694
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:24,077
Plenty.

695
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:27,681
Everybody out. Now!

696
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:32,918
Not you.

697
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:39,825
What are you doing?

698
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:41,528
It's a trade union.

699
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:43,496
Filled with Communists.

700
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,232
So? I haven't joined the Party.

701
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:47,367
They won't let me
bring you onto the project

702
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,102
because of this shit.

703
00:36:49,135 --> 00:36:50,903
They won't even let me
tell you what the project is.

704
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:53,373
Oh.
I know what the project is.

705
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:54,474
Oh, really?

706
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:55,808
We've all heard about Einstein

707
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,110
and Szilard's letter
to Roosevelt

708
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:58,944
warning him the Germans
could make a bomb,

709
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:01,847
and I know what it means
for the Nazis to have a bomb.

710
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,250
Oh, and I don't?

711
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:05,918
It's not your people
they're herding into camps.

712
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,020
It's mine.

713
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:11,191
You think that I tell them
about your politics.

714
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,860
The next time you're
coming home from a meeting,

715
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:16,929
why don't you take a look
in the rearview mirror?

716
00:37:16,962 --> 00:37:19,032
Listen to the sounds
on your phone line

717
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:22,135
and stop being so goddamn naive.

718
00:37:23,436 --> 00:37:24,970
Why would they care what I do?

719
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:26,972
Because you're
not just self-important,

720
00:37:27,006 --> 00:37:29,175
you're actually important.

721
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,777
Okay.

722
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:35,415
Okay. I get it.

723
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:37,517
If you could
just be a little more...

724
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,052
Pragmatic.

725
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:40,186
I'll talk to Lomanitz,
I'll talk to the others,

726
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,322
you don't have to worry.
It's done.

727
00:37:42,355 --> 00:37:44,124
Lawrence.

728
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:50,963
Then welcome to the war.

729
00:37:50,996 --> 00:37:53,300
I filled out my first
security questionnaire

730
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,601
and was informed

731
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:56,436
that my involvement
with left-wing groups

732
00:37:56,469 --> 00:38:00,407
would not prove a bar to my
working on the atomic program.

733
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,176
<i>Why were</i>
<i>his Communist associations</i>

734
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:06,313
not seen as a security risk
during the war?

735
00:38:06,346 --> 00:38:08,081
Senator, I can't possibly answer

736
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:11,451
for security clearance granted
years before I ever met the man.

737
00:38:11,484 --> 00:38:13,486
Fine. What about after?

738
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,455
After the war, Dr. Oppenheimer

739
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:19,259
was the most respected
scientific voice in the world.

740
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:21,328
That's why I asked him
to run the Institute,

741
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:24,464
that's why he advised
the Atomic Energy Commission.

742
00:38:24,497 --> 00:38:25,565
Simple as that.

743
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:28,201
What are they accusing me of?

744
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:30,002
I think they just want
to know what happened

745
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:32,539
between 1947 and 1954
to change your mind

746
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:34,607
on Oppenheimer's
security clearance.

747
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:37,377
I didn't.
I was chair of the AEC,

748
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,979
but it wasn't me that brought
the charges against Robert.

749
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:42,248
-Who did?
-Some former staff member

750
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,217
of the Joint
Congressional Committee.

751
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,320
He was a rabid anti-Communist
named Borden.

752
00:38:47,354 --> 00:38:49,656
He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

753
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:52,225
The FBI? Why not go
to the AEC, direct?

754
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:54,960
Why get caught
holding the knife yourself?

755
00:38:54,993 --> 00:38:57,430
What did Borden have
against Oppenheimer?

756
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:59,299
This was the McCarthy Era.

757
00:38:59,332 --> 00:39:04,237
People hounded out of jobs
for any hint of red. And then,

758
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,938
<i>reading Oppenheimer's</i>
<i>security file,</i>

759
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:08,141
<i>his Communist brother,</i>
<i>sister-in-law,</i>

760
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:10,243
<i>fiancée, best friend, wife.</i>

761
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:12,612
That's before we even
get to the Chevalier incident.

762
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:16,383
But how would Borden have access
to Oppenheimer's security file?

763
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:18,084
Because somebody gave it to him.

764
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:21,920
Somebody who wanted
Robert silenced.

765
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:23,556
-Who?
-Who knows?

766
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,126
Robert didn't take care
not to upset

767
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,395
the power brokers in Washington.

768
00:39:28,428 --> 00:39:31,297
His opinions on the atom
became definitive

769
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:34,234
and he wasn't always patient
with us mere mortals.

770
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:40,073
I came in for plenty
of harsh treatment.

771
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:43,276
There was an AEC vote

772
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:45,278
on the export of isotopes
to Norway,

773
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:48,281
<i>and they drafted in Robert</i>
<i>to make me look like a fool.</i>

774
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:50,015
But, Dr. Oppenheimer,

775
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:52,152
we've already heard
from Admiral Strauss that

776
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:55,020
these isotopes could be
useful to our enemies

777
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:56,356
in the production
of atomic weapons.

778
00:39:56,389 --> 00:39:58,258
Congressmen,
you could use a shovel

779
00:39:58,291 --> 00:39:59,726
in making atomic weapons.

780
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:00,959
In fact, you do.

781
00:40:00,993 --> 00:40:02,529
You could use a bottle of beer

782
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:03,962
in making atomic weapons.

783
00:40:03,996 --> 00:40:05,465
In fact, you do.

784
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:08,435
I say isotopes are less useful
than electronic components

785
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:11,237
but more useful than a sandwich.

786
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:16,342
<i>Genius is</i>
<i>no guarantee of wisdom.</i>

787
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:20,113
How could this man
who saw so much be so blind?

788
00:40:29,622 --> 00:40:31,057
Kitty?

789
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:37,697
Kitty?

790
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,134
Kitty, the project...

791
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,704
I'm in. I'm in.

792
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:46,506
Let's celebrate.

793
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,746
Shouldn't you go to him?

794
00:40:58,351 --> 00:41:01,521
I have been going to him
all fucking day.

795
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:27,012
Come here, darling.

796
00:41:28,114 --> 00:41:29,682
I don't know how to say this.

797
00:41:29,716 --> 00:41:32,418
I'm... I'm ashamed to ask.

798
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:34,387
Anything.

799
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,221
Take Peter.

800
00:41:35,255 --> 00:41:38,291
-Sure.
-No, for-for a while, Hoke.

801
00:41:38,324 --> 00:41:40,293
A while.

802
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:43,663
Does Kitty know you're here?

803
00:41:43,696 --> 00:41:45,431
Yes, of course she knows.

804
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:48,301
Of course she knows.

805
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:52,038
We're awful people.
Selfish, awful people.

806
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,541
Forget I asked.

807
00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:56,409
Selfish, awful people,

808
00:41:56,442 --> 00:41:58,845
they don't know
they're selfish and awful.

809
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:01,447
Sit, sit, sit.

810
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:06,586
Robert, you see beyond
the world we live in.

811
00:42:08,288 --> 00:42:10,857
There is a price
to be paid for that.

812
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,458
Of course we'll help you.

813
00:42:23,403 --> 00:42:25,572
Everything's changing, Robert.

814
00:42:25,605 --> 00:42:27,574
Having a child was always
going to change...

815
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:31,711
No, the world, it's pivoting
in some new direction.

816
00:42:31,744 --> 00:42:34,147
It's reforming.

817
00:42:35,915 --> 00:42:37,617
This is your moment.

818
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,453
We're putting together a group
to study feasibility...

819
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:43,289
"We" shouldn't be
doing anything. You should.

820
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,326
Lawrence won't get this done.

821
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:48,494
Or Tolman or Rabi. You will.

822
00:42:57,337 --> 00:42:59,472
Who are the uniforms?

823
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:02,175
I thought you might know.

824
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:05,478
Dr. Oppenheimer.

825
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:07,480
I'm Colonel Groves.

826
00:43:07,513 --> 00:43:09,749
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Nichols.

827
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:11,284
Have that dry-cleaned.

828
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,258
Well, if that's how you treat
Lieutenant Colonel,

829
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,662
I'd hate to see how you treat
a humble physicist.

830
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:24,764
Ah, if I ever meet one,
I'll let you know.

831
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:26,299
Ouch.

832
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:27,900
Theaters of combat
all over the world,

833
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:29,869
but I have to stay
in Washington.

834
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:32,605
-Why?
-I built the Pentagon.

835
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,274
The brass likes it so much
they made me take over

836
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,443
the Manhattan Engineer District.

837
00:43:37,477 --> 00:43:38,611
Which is?

838
00:43:38,645 --> 00:43:41,914
Oh, don't be a smart ass.
You know damn well what it is.

839
00:43:41,948 --> 00:43:43,650
You and half of every
physics department

840
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:46,519
across the country.
That's problem number one.

841
00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:48,287
I thought problem
number one would be

842
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:49,589
securing enough uranium ore.

843
00:43:49,622 --> 00:43:52,725
1,200 tons bought
the day I took charge.

844
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:53,926
Processing?

845
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,162
Just broke ground
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

846
00:43:56,963 --> 00:43:58,665
Now I'm looking
for a project director.

847
00:43:58,698 --> 00:44:00,800
And my name came up?

848
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:01,901
Nope.

849
00:44:03,037 --> 00:44:05,271
Even though you brought
quantum physics to America.

850
00:44:05,304 --> 00:44:06,673
Which made me curious.

851
00:44:06,706 --> 00:44:08,574
What have you found out?

852
00:44:09,475 --> 00:44:11,978
You're a dilettante,
a womanizer,

853
00:44:12,011 --> 00:44:13,346
a suspected Communist...

854
00:44:13,379 --> 00:44:14,781
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

855
00:44:14,814 --> 00:44:16,416
I said "suspected."

856
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:20,687
Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic...

857
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,754
Nothing good, no?

858
00:44:21,788 --> 00:44:23,456
Not even
"he's brilliant, but..."

859
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:25,291
Well, brilliance is taken
for granted

860
00:44:25,324 --> 00:44:26,826
in your circle, so no.

861
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:28,828
No, the only person who had
anything good to say

862
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:30,596
was Richard Tolman.

863
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,732
Tolman thinks
you have integrity,

864
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:34,901
but he also strikes me as a guy

865
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:37,303
who knows more about
science than people.

866
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:41,307
Yet here you are.
You don't take much on trust.

867
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,342
I don't take anything on trust.

868
00:44:46,913 --> 00:44:48,648
Why don't you
have a Nobel Prize?

869
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:49,749
Why aren't you a general?

870
00:44:49,782 --> 00:44:50,950
They're making me one for this.

871
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:52,351
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

872
00:44:52,385 --> 00:44:53,986
A Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

873
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,355
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

874
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:00,426
So how would you proceed?

875
00:45:01,928 --> 00:45:04,630
You're talking
about turning theory

876
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:06,833
into a practical weapons system

877
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:08,000
faster than the Nazis.

878
00:45:08,035 --> 00:45:09,769
Who have a 12-month head start.

879
00:45:09,802 --> 00:45:10,937
Eighteen.

880
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,338
How could you possibly
know that?

881
00:45:12,371 --> 00:45:14,407
Our fast neutron research
took six months.

882
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,942
The man they've
undoubtedly put in charge

883
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:17,376
will have made
that leap instantly.

884
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,611
Who do you think
they put in charge?

885
00:45:18,644 --> 00:45:19,746
Werner Heisenberg.

886
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:22,348
He has the most intuitive
understanding

887
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:24,051
of atomic structure
I have ever seen.

888
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:25,785
-You know his work?
-I know him.

889
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:27,653
<i>Just like I know Walther Bothe,</i>
<i>von Weizsäcker, Diebner.</i>

890
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:30,490
In a straight race,
the Germans win.

891
00:45:30,523 --> 00:45:33,259
-We've got one hope.
-Which is?

892
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,495
Anti-Semitism.

893
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:37,630
What?

894
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,500
Hitler called quantum physics
"Jewish science."

895
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:42,368
Said it right
to Einstein's face.

896
00:45:42,401 --> 00:45:45,638
Our one hope is that Hitler
is so... so blinded by hate

897
00:45:45,671 --> 00:45:47,473
that he's denied Heisenberg
proper resources,

898
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:49,442
because it'll take
vast resources.

899
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:51,010
Our nation's best scientists
working together.

900
00:45:51,044 --> 00:45:52,445
Right now, they're scattered.

901
00:45:52,478 --> 00:45:54,081
Which gives us
compartmentalization.

902
00:45:54,114 --> 00:45:55,982
All minds have
to see the whole task

903
00:45:56,015 --> 00:45:57,383
to contribute efficiently.

904
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:59,652
Poor security
may cost us the race.

905
00:45:59,685 --> 00:46:01,521
Inefficiency will.

906
00:46:01,554 --> 00:46:03,389
The Germans know
more than us anyway.

907
00:46:03,422 --> 00:46:05,525
The Russians don't.

908
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:09,495
Remind me,
who are we at war with?

909
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:11,964
Somebody with your past
doesn't want to be seen

910
00:46:11,998 --> 00:46:13,599
downplaying the importance

911
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:16,369
of security from
our Communist allies.

912
00:46:16,402 --> 00:46:19,072
Point taken. But, no.

913
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:21,407
You don't get
to say "no" to me.

914
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,709
It's my job to say "no" to you
when you're wrong.

915
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,745
So you have the job now?

916
00:46:25,778 --> 00:46:27,847
Uh, I'm considering it.

917
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,885
I'm starting to see
where you got your reputation.

918
00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:36,522
My favorite response,

919
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:38,891
"Oppenheimer couldn't
run a hamburger stand."

920
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,661
I couldn't.

921
00:46:43,696 --> 00:46:45,865
But I can run
the Manhattan Project.

922
00:46:46,732 --> 00:46:48,901
There's a way
to balance these things.

923
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:53,140
Keep the Rad Lab here
at Berkeley under Lawrence.

924
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:55,441
Met Lab in Chicago,
under Szilard.

925
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:57,910
Large-scale refining,
where did you say? Tennessee.

926
00:46:57,944 --> 00:46:59,612
-And Hanford.
-And Hanford.

927
00:46:59,645 --> 00:47:03,716
All America's industrial might
and scientific innovation,

928
00:47:03,749 --> 00:47:05,118
connected by rail.

929
00:47:05,152 --> 00:47:06,819
Focused on one goal.

930
00:47:06,853 --> 00:47:09,555
One point in space and time.
And it comes together here.

931
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:11,891
<i>A secret laboratory.</i>
<i>In the middle of nowhere,</i>

932
00:47:11,924 --> 00:47:13,392
<i>secure, self-sufficient,</i>

933
00:47:13,426 --> 00:47:14,794
equipment, housing, the works.

934
00:47:14,827 --> 00:47:16,996
Keep everyone there
until it's done.

935
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,066
It'll need a school,
stores, a church.

936
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:20,533
Why?

937
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:21,868
<i>If we don't let scientists</i>

938
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:23,603
bring their families,
we'll never get the best.

939
00:47:23,636 --> 00:47:25,705
You want security,
build a town, build it fast.

940
00:47:25,738 --> 00:47:26,806
Where?

941
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,778
Welcome to Los Alamos.

942
00:47:32,812 --> 00:47:35,615
Now, there's a boys school
we'll have to commandeer,

943
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:37,617
and the local Indians come
up here for burial rites.

944
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,887
But, apart from that, nothing.
Forty miles. Any direction.

945
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,855
Enough to find the perfect spot.

946
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:45,391
-For?
-Success.

947
00:47:50,663 --> 00:47:52,665
Build him a town. Fast.

948
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:56,203
Let's go recruit
some scientists.

949
00:47:56,236 --> 00:47:58,571
Why would I leave my family?

950
00:47:58,604 --> 00:48:00,040
I told you,
you can bring your family.

951
00:48:00,073 --> 00:48:01,507
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

952
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,643
A soldier? He's a general.

953
00:48:03,676 --> 00:48:05,511
I've got all the soldier I need.

954
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:07,114
What can I tell them?

955
00:48:07,147 --> 00:48:09,482
Heisenberg, Diebner,
Bothe and Bohr.

956
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:10,816
What do these men
have in common?

957
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,852
The greatest minds
on atomic theory.

958
00:48:12,885 --> 00:48:14,221
-Yes, and?
-Uh...

959
00:48:14,254 --> 00:48:17,523
As much as you like,

960
00:48:17,556 --> 00:48:19,692
until you feel my boot
on your balls.

961
00:48:19,725 --> 00:48:22,495
You know isotopes
and you know explosives

962
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:23,829
better than anyone in the world.

963
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:26,465
But you can't tell us
what you're doing?

964
00:48:29,535 --> 00:48:31,771
-I don't know.
-The Nazis have them.

965
00:48:31,804 --> 00:48:33,940
-Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
-Under Nazi occupation.

966
00:48:33,973 --> 00:48:35,841
Did they stop printing
newspapers in Princeton?

967
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:38,211
Why would we go
to the middle of nowhere

968
00:48:38,245 --> 00:48:39,712
for who knows how long?

969
00:48:39,745 --> 00:48:41,847
For a year or two. Or three.

970
00:48:42,848 --> 00:48:46,452
Uh, General, could you
give us a moment?

971
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,589
It's about unleashing
the strong force...

972
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:53,126
...before the Nazis do.

973
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,095
Oh, my God.

974
00:48:55,128 --> 00:48:56,229
Niels won't work for the Nazis.

975
00:48:56,263 --> 00:48:57,563
No, never.

976
00:48:57,596 --> 00:48:59,899
But while they have him,
we don't.

977
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:01,101
That's why I need you.

978
00:49:01,134 --> 00:49:03,103
Why would you think I'd do that?

979
00:49:03,136 --> 00:49:04,971
"Why?" "Why?"

980
00:49:05,004 --> 00:49:07,207
How about because this is the
most important fucking thing

981
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,242
to ever happen
in the history of the world.

982
00:49:09,276 --> 00:49:10,710
How about that?

983
00:49:11,278 --> 00:49:12,712
Fuck.

984
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,019
They are not gonna
let me onto this project.

985
00:49:20,053 --> 00:49:22,122
And failing a security check
is not gonna be good

986
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:23,823
for a career,
even after the war.

987
00:49:23,856 --> 00:49:26,625
So you're a fellow traveler.
So what?

988
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:28,027
This is a national emergency.

989
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:31,231
I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

990
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:32,565
They need us.

991
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:34,767
Until they don't.

992
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:40,240
Is there any chance of getting
Bohr out of Denmark?

993
00:49:40,273 --> 00:49:43,276
Nah, no dice.
I checked with the British.

994
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,611
Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

995
00:49:45,644 --> 00:49:47,047
there's just no way.

996
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:50,016
Is he that important?

997
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,086
How many people do you know
who proved Einstein wrong?

998
00:49:54,154 --> 00:49:56,256
You know, it really would
be quicker to take a plane.

999
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:58,024
No, plane's too risky.

1000
00:49:58,058 --> 00:50:00,526
Country needs us.

1001
00:50:02,895 --> 00:50:03,996
The Harvard guys,

1002
00:50:04,031 --> 00:50:06,599
they say the building's
too small for the cyclotron.

1003
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,736
Get them together
with the architects.

1004
00:50:13,939 --> 00:50:15,941
When's this place
supposed to open?

1005
00:50:19,046 --> 00:50:19,845
Two months.

1006
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,250
Robert, you're
the great improviser,

1007
00:50:23,283 --> 00:50:25,318
but this...

1008
00:50:25,352 --> 00:50:26,952
you can't do in your head.

1009
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:29,588
Four divisions.

1010
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:34,327
Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

1011
00:50:34,361 --> 00:50:35,328
Who's running Theoretical?

1012
00:50:35,362 --> 00:50:36,762
I am.

1013
00:50:36,796 --> 00:50:37,997
That's what I was afraid of.

1014
00:50:38,031 --> 00:50:39,899
You're spread too thin.

1015
00:50:41,101 --> 00:50:42,802
So you take Theoretical.

1016
00:50:45,372 --> 00:50:48,607
I'm not coming here, Robert.

1017
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:55,915
Why not?

1018
00:51:01,787 --> 00:51:05,858
You drop a bomb and it falls
on the just and the unjust.

1019
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:09,762
I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

1020
00:51:09,795 --> 00:51:12,199
to be a weapon
of mass destruction.

1021
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:22,741
Izzy.

1022
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:28,013
I don't know if we can
be trusted with such a weapon.

1023
00:51:29,382 --> 00:51:32,685
But I know the Nazis can't.

1024
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:38,891
We have no choice.

1025
00:51:40,293 --> 00:51:41,727
Then...

1026
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:45,432
...the second thing
you'll have to do is appoint

1027
00:51:45,465 --> 00:51:47,733
Hans Bethe to run
the Theoretical division.

1028
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:51,937
Wait, what was the first?

1029
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:54,441
Take off
that ridiculous uniform.

1030
00:51:54,474 --> 00:51:55,674
You're a scientist.

1031
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,310
Groves is insisting we join.

1032
00:51:57,344 --> 00:51:59,778
Tell Groves to go
shit in his hat.

1033
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:03,283
They need us for who we are.
So be yourself.

1034
00:52:03,316 --> 00:52:05,285
Only better.

1035
00:52:44,324 --> 00:52:46,359
This is the only key.

1036
00:52:46,393 --> 00:52:47,826
And Teller's already here.

1037
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,728
Shall I just show him in?

1038
00:52:49,762 --> 00:52:51,431
No, let's wait for the others.

1039
00:52:59,372 --> 00:53:00,373
Let's get started.

1040
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:02,475
Hello, Edward.

1041
00:53:02,509 --> 00:53:04,211
Yes.

1042
00:53:04,244 --> 00:53:05,945
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

1043
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:08,981
until the T-section
at Los Alamos is finished.

1044
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:11,318
-Edward, can I please...
-It is more important.

1045
00:53:13,386 --> 00:53:15,355
When I calculated
the chain reaction,

1046
00:53:15,388 --> 00:53:18,091
I found a rather
troubling possibility.

1047
00:53:18,124 --> 00:53:20,227
No.

1048
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,494
But this can't be right.

1049
00:53:21,528 --> 00:53:23,463
Show me how
you did your calculations.

1050
00:53:23,496 --> 00:53:24,897
Yes.

1051
00:53:28,401 --> 00:53:29,469
It's exponential.

1052
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:31,971
No. No, no, no. No.

1053
00:53:34,507 --> 00:53:36,509
This is fantasy.

1054
00:53:36,543 --> 00:53:38,811
Teller's calculations
can't be right.

1055
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:41,514
Do them yourself
while I go to Princeton.

1056
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:43,383
-What for?
-To talk to Einstein.

1057
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,985
Well, there's not much
common ground between you two.

1058
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:49,055
That's why
I should get his view.

1059
00:53:52,492 --> 00:53:54,494
-Albert.
-Hmm?

1060
00:53:54,527 --> 00:53:57,430
Ah. Dr. Oppenheimer.

1061
00:53:57,464 --> 00:53:58,931
Well, have you met Dr. Gödel?

1062
00:53:58,964 --> 00:54:00,533
We walk here most days.

1063
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:05,372
Trees are the most
inspiring structures.

1064
00:54:05,405 --> 00:54:06,872
Albert, might I have a word?

1065
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:10,310
Of course. 'Scuse me, Kurt.

1066
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:14,247
You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

1067
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:15,881
Even in Princeton.

1068
00:54:15,914 --> 00:54:19,018
He's convinced that the Nazis
can poison his food.

1069
00:54:19,052 --> 00:54:20,320
Mm.

1070
00:54:20,353 --> 00:54:22,188
Hmm? Huh.

1071
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:25,891
Wha...

1072
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:33,266
Whose... Whose work is this?

1073
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,334
Teller's.

1074
00:54:35,468 --> 00:54:37,936
What do you take it to mean?

1075
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,905
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

1076
00:54:39,938 --> 00:54:43,976
releasing neutrons
to smash into other nuclei.

1077
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:46,212
Criticality,
a point of no return,

1078
00:54:46,246 --> 00:54:47,846
massive explosive force.

1079
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,216
But this time,
the chain reaction doesn't stop.

1080
00:54:51,117 --> 00:54:54,087
It would ignite the atmosphere.

1081
00:54:55,155 --> 00:54:57,123
When we detonate
an atomic device,

1082
00:54:57,157 --> 00:54:59,326
we might start
a chain reaction that...

1083
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:01,827
...destroys the world.

1084
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:04,897
So here we are, hmm?

1085
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,235
Lost in your quantum world
of probabilities

1086
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:11,003
and needing certainty.

1087
00:55:11,037 --> 00:55:13,906
Can you run
the calculations yourself?

1088
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:15,342
About the only thing

1089
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:18,645
you and I have in common
is a disdain for mathematics.

1090
00:55:18,678 --> 00:55:21,247
Who's working on this
in-in Berkeley?

1091
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:22,582
Hans Bethe.

1092
00:55:22,615 --> 00:55:24,451
Well, he'll get to the truth.

1093
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:28,954
And if the truth
is catastrophic?

1094
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:30,290
Then you stop.

1095
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:34,060
And you share your findings
with the Nazis.

1096
00:55:34,094 --> 00:55:37,230
So neither side
destroys the world.

1097
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:41,468
Robert.

1098
00:55:42,935 --> 00:55:46,139
This is yours, not mine.

1099
00:55:59,017 --> 00:56:00,420
Teller's wrong.

1100
00:56:00,453 --> 00:56:01,654
He's wrong.

1101
00:56:11,331 --> 00:56:14,033
When you know
Teller's critical assumptions,

1102
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:15,402
the real picture emerges.

1103
00:56:15,435 --> 00:56:17,237
Bottom line?

1104
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:19,372
The chances of an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction

1105
00:56:19,406 --> 00:56:20,407
are near zero.

1106
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,076
Near zero.

1107
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:25,378
-Oppie, this is good news.
-Mm.

1108
00:56:26,713 --> 00:56:27,946
Can you run them again?

1109
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,716
No, you'll get the same answer.

1110
00:56:29,749 --> 00:56:31,317
Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

1111
00:56:31,351 --> 00:56:34,187
the best assurance
you're going to get is this.

1112
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,288
Near zero.

1113
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:40,160
Theory
will take you only so far.

1114
00:56:40,193 --> 00:56:41,694
-Mm.
<i>-Hello!</i>

1115
00:56:41,728 --> 00:56:43,029
-Hello, you.
-Hi.

1116
00:56:43,062 --> 00:56:44,397
We missed him.

1117
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:45,565
You want to adopt?

1118
00:56:45,598 --> 00:56:46,999
She's kidding.

1119
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:48,967
We wanted to see you
before we left.

1120
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:52,172
For parts unknown.

1121
00:56:52,205 --> 00:56:54,741
You know who
I ran into the other day?

1122
00:56:54,774 --> 00:56:56,409
Eltenton.

1123
00:56:56,443 --> 00:56:57,710
Oh.

1124
00:56:57,744 --> 00:56:59,446
The chemist from Shell?
The union guy?

1125
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:03,349
Yeah. He...
The, uh, F.A.E.C.T. guy.

1126
00:57:03,383 --> 00:57:06,753
He was moaning about
how we're handling the war.

1127
00:57:06,786 --> 00:57:08,987
How so?

1128
00:57:09,021 --> 00:57:11,758
Lack of cooperation
with our allies.

1129
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:14,127
Apparently
our government's not sharing

1130
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,262
any research with the Russians.

1131
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:17,263
Well, he said,

1132
00:57:17,297 --> 00:57:20,033
"Most scientists think
the policy is stupid."

1133
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:25,205
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1134
00:57:25,238 --> 00:57:27,607
He mentioned that if anyone

1135
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,610
had anything
they wanted to pass on,

1136
00:57:30,643 --> 00:57:32,479
uh, going around
official channels,

1137
00:57:32,512 --> 00:57:34,447
that he could help.

1138
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:44,757
That would be treason.

1139
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:47,627
Yes, of course.

1140
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,462
I just thought you should know.

1141
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:54,067
The brat is down.

1142
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,468
Where are the martinis?

1143
00:58:00,673 --> 00:58:02,175
Coming right up.

1144
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:03,676
<i>Conversation ended there.</i>

1145
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:05,812
Nothing in our
long-standing friendship

1146
00:58:05,845 --> 00:58:07,413
would have led me to believe

1147
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:10,183
that Chevalier was actually
seeking information,

1148
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:12,685
and I am certain
that he had no idea

1149
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:15,020
of the work in which
I was engaged.

1150
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:21,528
It has long been clear to me

1151
00:58:21,561 --> 00:58:24,264
that I should have reported
this incident at once.

1152
00:58:24,297 --> 00:58:25,798
<i>The Oppenheimer situation</i>

1153
00:58:25,832 --> 00:58:28,735
<i>highlights the tension</i>
<i>between scientists</i>

1154
00:58:28,768 --> 00:58:30,370
and the security apparatus.

1155
00:58:30,403 --> 00:58:32,272
In hopes of learning
how the nominee handled

1156
00:58:32,305 --> 00:58:34,641
such issues during
his time at the AEC,

1157
00:58:34,674 --> 00:58:38,177
we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

1158
00:58:38,845 --> 00:58:40,413
Who are they bringing in?

1159
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:41,414
They hadn't said.

1160
00:58:41,447 --> 00:58:42,815
Mr. Chairman, if I may,

1161
00:58:42,849 --> 00:58:45,385
I'm nominated
for Commerce Secretary.

1162
00:58:45,418 --> 00:58:47,720
Why seek the opinion
of scientists?

1163
00:58:47,754 --> 00:58:50,089
This is a Cabinet post, Admiral.

1164
00:58:50,123 --> 00:58:52,292
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1165
00:58:52,325 --> 00:58:55,128
Well, I'd like to know the name
of the scientist testifying.

1166
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:56,663
I'd like the chance
to cross-examine.

1167
00:58:56,696 --> 00:58:58,831
This is not a court.

1168
00:58:58,865 --> 00:59:01,267
Formality, huh?

1169
00:59:01,301 --> 00:59:02,569
No presidential Cabinet nominee

1170
00:59:02,602 --> 00:59:05,171
has failed to be confirmed
since 1925.

1171
00:59:05,204 --> 00:59:07,307
This is just how
the game is played.

1172
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,641
It's in the bag, Lewis.

1173
00:59:08,675 --> 00:59:09,876
So play nice.

1174
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:12,178
<i>They bring in a scientist,</i>
<i>so what?</i>

1175
00:59:12,211 --> 00:59:14,213
You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

1176
00:59:14,247 --> 00:59:16,282
They resent anyone
who questions their judgment,

1177
00:59:16,316 --> 00:59:18,318
<i>especially if you're</i>
<i>not one of them.</i>

1178
00:59:18,351 --> 00:59:19,652
I was chair of the AEC.

1179
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:22,121
I'm easy to blame
for what happened to Robert.

1180
00:59:22,155 --> 00:59:23,456
We can't have
the Senate thinking

1181
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:26,593
the scientific community
doesn't support you, sir.

1182
00:59:26,626 --> 00:59:28,461
Or should we pivot?

1183
00:59:28,494 --> 00:59:30,463
-To what?
-And embrace it.

1184
00:59:30,496 --> 00:59:33,266
"I fought Oppenheimer,
and the US won."

1185
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:34,867
I-I don't think
we need to go there.

1186
00:59:34,901 --> 00:59:37,170
Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

1187
00:59:37,203 --> 00:59:38,638
-Teller.
-He'll make an impression.

1188
00:59:38,671 --> 00:59:40,740
Can you get the name of
the scientist they've called?

1189
00:59:40,773 --> 00:59:42,342
-Probably.
-Find out if he was

1190
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:44,744
based in Chicago
or Los Alamos during the war.

1191
00:59:44,777 --> 00:59:46,145
Why does that matter?

1192
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:47,380
Well, if he was
based in Chicago,

1193
00:59:47,413 --> 00:59:48,815
then he worked
under Szilard and Fermi,

1194
00:59:48,848 --> 00:59:51,150
not the cult of Oppie
at Los Alamos.

1195
00:59:51,184 --> 00:59:52,418
Robert built that damn place.

1196
00:59:52,452 --> 00:59:55,221
He was founder, mayor, sheriff,

1197
00:59:55,254 --> 00:59:56,656
all rolled into one.

1198
01:00:09,602 --> 01:00:11,404
All it needs is a saloon.

1199
01:00:39,832 --> 01:00:42,402
There's no kitchen.

1200
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:46,372
Really? We'll fix that.

1201
01:00:52,278 --> 01:00:55,682
Barbed wire, guns.

1202
01:00:55,715 --> 01:00:56,816
Oppie.

1203
01:00:56,849 --> 01:00:58,484
We're at war, Hans.

1204
01:01:00,887 --> 01:01:03,456
Halifax. 1917.

1205
01:01:03,489 --> 01:01:06,459
A cargo ship carrying munitions
explodes in the harbor.

1206
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:11,798
A vast and sudden
chemical reaction.

1207
01:01:15,468 --> 01:01:18,304
The biggest man-made
explosion in history.

1208
01:01:18,337 --> 01:01:20,306
Now let's calculate
how much more destructive

1209
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:23,009
it would have been
if it were a nuclear

1210
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:24,711
and not a chemical reaction.

1211
01:01:24,744 --> 01:01:28,381
Expressing power in terms
of tons of TNT.

1212
01:01:28,414 --> 01:01:29,916
But it will be thousands.

1213
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:33,386
Well, then kilotons.

1214
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:40,326
Using U-235,

1215
01:01:40,359 --> 01:01:42,929
-the bomb will need a...
-Uh-uh.

1216
01:01:42,962 --> 01:01:46,033
Sorry. Gadget will need
a 33-pound sphere

1217
01:01:46,066 --> 01:01:47,533
about this size.

1218
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:51,370
Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

1219
01:01:52,772 --> 01:01:54,006
Here's the amount of uranium

1220
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:57,376
Oak Ridge refined
all of last month.

1221
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:03,783
And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

1222
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:08,020
Now, if we can enrich
these amounts,

1223
01:02:08,055 --> 01:02:10,857
we need a way to detonate them.

1224
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,992
Are we boring you, Edward?

1225
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:14,627
A little bit, yes.

1226
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:15,895
May I ask why?

1227
01:02:15,928 --> 01:02:17,363
We all entered this room

1228
01:02:17,396 --> 01:02:19,332
knowing a fission bomb
was possible.

1229
01:02:19,365 --> 01:02:21,968
How 'bout we leave it
with something new?

1230
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:23,002
Such as?

1231
01:02:23,036 --> 01:02:25,772
Instead of uranium or plutonium,

1232
01:02:25,805 --> 01:02:26,806
we use hydrogen.

1233
01:02:28,374 --> 01:02:29,976
-Heavy hydrogen.
-Hydrogen.

1234
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:32,779
Deuterium. You see?

1235
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:34,514
We compact the atoms together

1236
01:02:34,547 --> 01:02:37,617
under great pressure
to induce a fusion reaction.

1237
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:41,387
Then we'll get not kilotons,

1238
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,488
but megatons.

1239
01:02:42,522 --> 01:02:43,456
A big fission reaction...

1240
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:45,058
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1241
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:49,796
So how do you generate enough
force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1242
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:51,898
A small fission bomb.

1243
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:53,633
There we are.

1244
01:02:55,568 --> 01:02:57,370
Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

1245
01:02:57,403 --> 01:02:59,372
can we get back
to the business at hand?

1246
01:02:59,405 --> 01:03:00,740
The isotopes issue

1247
01:03:00,773 --> 01:03:04,410
wasn't your most important
policy disagreement

1248
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:06,079
with Dr. Oppenheimer.

1249
01:03:06,113 --> 01:03:08,514
It was the hydrogen bomb,
wasn't it?

1250
01:03:08,548 --> 01:03:11,417
Uh, as colleagues,
we agreed to disagree

1251
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:13,452
on a great many things, uh,

1252
01:03:13,486 --> 01:03:14,720
and, well, one of them

1253
01:03:14,754 --> 01:03:17,824
was the need
for an H-bomb program, yes.

1254
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:33,439
Thanks for convening
on short notice.

1255
01:03:33,472 --> 01:03:34,941
I can't believe it.

1256
01:03:35,942 --> 01:03:37,476
Well, here we are.

1257
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:39,512
Catch me up. What do we know?

1258
01:03:39,545 --> 01:03:42,049
One of our B-29s
over the North Pacific

1259
01:03:42,082 --> 01:03:43,583
has detected radiation.

1260
01:03:43,616 --> 01:03:45,384
Do we have the filter papers?

1261
01:03:45,418 --> 01:03:47,420
There's no doubt what this is.

1262
01:03:47,453 --> 01:03:48,654
White House says
there's a doubt.

1263
01:03:48,688 --> 01:03:50,123
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1264
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:52,859
Are those the long-range
detection filter papers?

1265
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:55,862
It's an atomic test.

1266
01:03:58,497 --> 01:03:59,899
The Russians have a bomb.

1267
01:03:59,932 --> 01:04:03,669
We're supposed to be years
ahead of them, but some...

1268
01:04:03,703 --> 01:04:06,005
What were you guys
doing at Los Alamos?

1269
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:07,174
Wasn't security tight?

1270
01:04:07,207 --> 01:04:08,708
Of course it was.
You weren't there.

1271
01:04:08,741 --> 01:04:11,144
-It was...
-Forgive me, Doctor...

1272
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:13,613
but I was there.

1273
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,015
We can now consider

1274
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:17,984
the actual mechanics
of detonation.

1275
01:04:18,017 --> 01:04:19,152
Any ideas?

1276
01:04:19,186 --> 01:04:20,920
I call this "shooting."

1277
01:04:20,953 --> 01:04:24,490
We fire a chunk of fissionable
material into a larger sphere

1278
01:04:24,523 --> 01:04:27,026
with enough force
to achieve criticality.

1279
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,728
What do we think? Anyone?

1280
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:30,563
I've been
thinking about implosion.

1281
01:04:30,596 --> 01:04:32,565
Explosives around the sphere
blast inwards,

1282
01:04:32,598 --> 01:04:34,634
crushing the material.

1283
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:36,602
I'd like to investigate
that idea.

1284
01:04:36,636 --> 01:04:38,938
I'll talk to Ordnance,
get you blowing things up.

1285
01:04:39,939 --> 01:04:41,041
Progress?

1286
01:04:41,074 --> 01:04:42,909
Nice to see you too.

1287
01:04:42,942 --> 01:04:44,710
Meet the British contingent.

1288
01:04:44,744 --> 01:04:46,579
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

1289
01:04:46,612 --> 01:04:48,481
How long have you been British?

1290
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:49,715
Since Hitler told me
I wasn't German.

1291
01:04:49,749 --> 01:04:53,552
Uh-huh.
Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

1292
01:04:53,586 --> 01:04:55,454
School's up and running.

1293
01:04:55,488 --> 01:04:57,790
Bar. Always running.

1294
01:04:57,823 --> 01:05:00,826
And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

1295
01:05:01,794 --> 01:05:03,796
-Is that...
-Mrs. Serber, yes.

1296
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:05,232
I've offered jobs
to all the wives.

1297
01:05:05,265 --> 01:05:06,732
Admin, librarians, computation.

1298
01:05:06,766 --> 01:05:09,069
We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

1299
01:05:09,102 --> 01:05:11,671
-Are these women qualified?
-Don't be absurd.

1300
01:05:11,704 --> 01:05:14,074
These are some of the brightest
minds in our community.

1301
01:05:14,107 --> 01:05:15,675
And they're already
security cleared.

1302
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,576
I've informed General Groves
you've been holding

1303
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,079
cross-divisional
open discussions

1304
01:05:19,112 --> 01:05:20,813
-on a nightly basis.
-Shut them down.

1305
01:05:20,846 --> 01:05:23,183
Compartmentalization is the
key to maintaining security...

1306
01:05:23,216 --> 01:05:24,717
It's only the top men.

1307
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,585
Who presumably communicate
with subordinates.

1308
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:27,820
These men aren't stupid.

1309
01:05:27,853 --> 01:05:29,689
-They can be discreet.
-I don't like it.

1310
01:05:29,722 --> 01:05:32,625
You don't like anything enough
for that to be a fair test.

1311
01:05:38,165 --> 01:05:40,700
Once a week. Top men only.

1312
01:05:40,733 --> 01:05:42,102
I'd like to bring
my brother here.

1313
01:05:42,135 --> 01:05:43,602
No.

1314
01:05:44,237 --> 01:05:46,005
Uh, Nichols...

1315
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,076
I still haven't heard
that my security clearance

1316
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:50,676
-has been approved.
-It hasn't.

1317
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:52,079
We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

1318
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:53,146
No, you should wait.

1319
01:05:54,348 --> 01:05:55,449
You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start.

1320
01:05:55,481 --> 01:05:58,551
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact
that your security clearance

1321
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:00,586
is proving difficult to obtain
is not my fault.

1322
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:01,887
It's yours.

1323
01:06:01,921 --> 01:06:03,856
May not be your fault,
but it's your problem.

1324
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:04,890
Because I'm going.

1325
01:06:04,924 --> 01:06:08,694
And how many people
were in these, uh,

1326
01:06:08,728 --> 01:06:10,930
-open discussions?
-Too many.

1327
01:06:10,963 --> 01:06:12,299
Compartmentalization was
supposed to be the protocol.

1328
01:06:12,332 --> 01:06:14,267
We were in a race
against the Nazis.

1329
01:06:14,301 --> 01:06:16,736
And now the race
is against the Soviets.

1330
01:06:16,769 --> 01:06:18,271
-Not unless we start it.
-Robert.

1331
01:06:18,305 --> 01:06:21,707
They just fired a starting gun.

1332
01:06:21,741 --> 01:06:23,709
What's the nature
of the device they detonated?

1333
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:25,278
The data indicates
it may have been

1334
01:06:25,312 --> 01:06:27,613
a plutonium implosion device.

1335
01:06:27,646 --> 01:06:30,750
Like the one you built
at Los Alamos.

1336
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,618
The Russians have a bomb,

1337
01:06:32,651 --> 01:06:33,919
Truman needs to know
what's next.

1338
01:06:33,953 --> 01:06:35,755
What's next? Arms talks.

1339
01:06:35,788 --> 01:06:37,656
-Arms talks.
-Obviously.

1340
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:39,792
What about the Super?

1341
01:06:39,825 --> 01:06:41,560
Does Truman even know about it?

1342
01:06:41,594 --> 01:06:43,596
Did we brief him on that?

1343
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:44,697
Not specifically.

1344
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:46,033
We still don't know

1345
01:06:46,066 --> 01:06:47,833
if a hydrogen bomb's
technically feasible.

1346
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:49,769
Right, my understanding
is that Teller proposed it?

1347
01:06:49,802 --> 01:06:51,637
-Yes.
-At Los Alamos?

1348
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:53,306
Teller's designs have always
been wildly impractical.

1349
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,674
You'd have to deliver
by ox cart.

1350
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:56,976
-Not airplane.
-Oppie.

1351
01:06:57,009 --> 01:07:00,713
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence,
you want to comment?

1352
01:07:01,947 --> 01:07:03,050
No.

1353
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:07,187
Because if it can
put us ahead again,

1354
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:10,257
the President
of the United States

1355
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:12,292
needs to know about it.

1356
01:07:13,826 --> 01:07:15,628
And if the Russians
know about it already,

1357
01:07:15,661 --> 01:07:18,664
from a spy at Los Alamos,

1358
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:19,999
then we've gotta get going.

1359
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:23,002
There's no proof there was
a spy at Los Alamos.

1360
01:07:23,036 --> 01:07:24,104
Robert.

1361
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:30,709
They put it under
the football stadium?

1362
01:07:30,743 --> 01:07:32,678
The field's not in use anymore.

1363
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:34,947
Just as well.

1364
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:38,684
-Oppie.
-Dr. Fermi.

1365
01:07:41,388 --> 01:07:42,721
I hear you got a little town.

1366
01:07:42,755 --> 01:07:43,989
Yes. Come and see.

1367
01:07:45,724 --> 01:07:49,829
Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

1368
01:07:49,862 --> 01:07:51,797
Everybody will go crazy.

1369
01:07:51,831 --> 01:07:55,701
Thank you for the vote
of confidence, Szilard.

1370
01:07:55,734 --> 01:07:59,372
Do we really... do we really
need that in the notes?

1371
01:07:59,406 --> 01:08:01,841
When are you going
to try it out?

1372
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:02,908
We did.

1373
01:08:02,942 --> 01:08:07,314
The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

1374
01:08:07,347 --> 01:08:08,981
Didn't Groves tell you?

1375
01:08:09,014 --> 01:08:10,649
No.

1376
01:08:15,155 --> 01:08:18,258
One at a time, please,
one at a time.

1377
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:19,758
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1378
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,330
I tried Personnel.
They asked if I could type.

1379
01:08:23,363 --> 01:08:24,663
Can you?

1380
01:08:24,697 --> 01:08:25,831
Harvard forgot to teach that

1381
01:08:25,865 --> 01:08:27,700
on the graduate
chemistry course.

1382
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:31,971
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig here
on the plutonium team.

1383
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:39,412
What the hell
were you doing in Chicago?

1384
01:08:39,446 --> 01:08:40,913
Visiting the Met?

1385
01:08:40,946 --> 01:08:41,947
-Why? Why?
-Well, you can't talk to...

1386
01:08:41,981 --> 01:08:44,016
Because we have every right...

1387
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,386
You have just the rights
that I give you.

1388
01:08:46,419 --> 01:08:47,887
No more, no less.

1389
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,357
We are adults
trying to run a project here.

1390
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:52,092
This is ridiculous.

1391
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,893
Tell him.

1392
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:57,063
Compartmentalization
is the protocol we agreed to.

1393
01:08:58,198 --> 01:08:59,432
Enough of this madhouse.

1394
01:08:59,466 --> 01:09:01,834
Nobody can work
under these conditions.

1395
01:09:01,867 --> 01:09:06,306
You know what, Generalissimo?
I quit.

1396
01:09:06,339 --> 01:09:07,740
Thanks for nothing.

1397
01:09:09,842 --> 01:09:11,344
Better off without him.

1398
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:13,812
Aren't you more concerned

1399
01:09:13,846 --> 01:09:16,216
about his discretion out there?

1400
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:18,652
We'll have him killed.

1401
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:22,055
I was just kidding.

1402
01:09:22,088 --> 01:09:25,024
-No, he hates me, not America.
-You know, General,

1403
01:09:25,058 --> 01:09:27,394
not everyone has levers
to pull like mine.

1404
01:09:27,427 --> 01:09:29,262
I don't think I understand.

1405
01:09:29,296 --> 01:09:31,464
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past.

1406
01:09:31,498 --> 01:09:33,233
You hired me because of it.

1407
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:36,203
So you could control me.

1408
01:09:36,236 --> 01:09:38,837
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1409
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:40,906
I'm just a humble soldier.

1410
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:42,442
You're neither humble
nor just a soldier.

1411
01:09:42,475 --> 01:09:43,476
You studied engineering at MIT.

1412
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:45,345
Guilty as charged.

1413
01:09:45,378 --> 01:09:46,879
Well, now we understand
each other,

1414
01:09:46,912 --> 01:09:48,348
perhaps you can get me
my security clearance

1415
01:09:48,381 --> 01:09:51,184
so I can perform
this miracle for you.

1416
01:09:56,089 --> 01:09:57,823
<i>General Groves, were you aware</i>

1417
01:09:57,856 --> 01:10:00,160
<i>of Dr. Oppenheimer's</i>
<i>left-wing associations</i>

1418
01:10:00,193 --> 01:10:01,860
<i>when you appointed him?</i>

1419
01:10:01,894 --> 01:10:03,530
I was aware that there
were suspicions about him.

1420
01:10:03,563 --> 01:10:05,432
I was aware he had
a very extreme

1421
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:06,832
liberal background.

1422
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:08,468
In your opinion,
would he ever consciously

1423
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:09,802
commit a disloyal act?

1424
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:11,438
I would be amazed if he did.

1425
01:10:11,471 --> 01:10:14,541
So you had complete
confidence in his integrity.

1426
01:10:14,574 --> 01:10:15,975
At Los Alamos, yes,

1427
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,344
which is where
I really knew him.

1428
01:10:17,377 --> 01:10:19,346
General,
did your security officers

1429
01:10:19,379 --> 01:10:20,846
on the project advise you

1430
01:10:20,879 --> 01:10:22,349
against the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1431
01:10:22,382 --> 01:10:26,186
They could not and would not
clear him until I insisted.

1432
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:28,854
And it's safe to say that you
had a pretty good knowledge

1433
01:10:28,887 --> 01:10:30,123
of Dr. Oppenheimer's
security file.

1434
01:10:30,156 --> 01:10:31,824
I did.

1435
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:33,025
Well, then there's only
really one question

1436
01:10:33,059 --> 01:10:34,527
I need answered here today.

1437
01:10:34,561 --> 01:10:36,263
In light of
the current AEC guidelines,

1438
01:10:36,296 --> 01:10:38,998
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1439
01:10:39,032 --> 01:10:41,101
Do you have the guidelines?

1440
01:10:48,174 --> 01:10:50,843
Under current AEC guidelines,

1441
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:52,911
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1442
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:08,927
Physics and New Mexico, huh?

1443
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:11,997
My God. What a trek.

1444
01:11:12,032 --> 01:11:13,500
That's why you need a liaison.

1445
01:11:13,533 --> 01:11:15,068
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1446
01:11:16,236 --> 01:11:17,304
You're gonna be okay.

1447
01:11:17,337 --> 01:11:18,505
This way, gentlemen.

1448
01:11:28,481 --> 01:11:30,317
-Dr. Lawrence.
-Leslie.

1449
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,918
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

1450
01:11:32,951 --> 01:11:35,288
Compartmentalization.
I understand completely.

1451
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,459
Okay.

1452
01:11:40,627 --> 01:11:42,062
Thank you.

1453
01:11:49,968 --> 01:11:51,204
<i>Greetings from Berkeley.</i>

1454
01:11:51,237 --> 01:11:53,373
I am here to update you
on our progress

1455
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:54,940
and solicit your input.

1456
01:11:54,973 --> 01:11:56,343
To do so,
I am going to have to share

1457
01:11:56,376 --> 01:12:00,046
a few things that
General Groves told me not to.

1458
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,880
Sorry, General,
I said I understood,

1459
01:12:01,914 --> 01:12:02,981
not that I agreed.

1460
01:12:03,015 --> 01:12:04,551
'Kay.

1461
01:12:04,584 --> 01:12:06,619
Gentlemen, to business.

1462
01:12:06,653 --> 01:12:09,021
There were rumors of espionage
at Los Alamos.

1463
01:12:09,055 --> 01:12:10,523
Unsubstantiated.
Unsubstantiated.

1464
01:12:10,557 --> 01:12:12,024
I'm told

1465
01:12:12,058 --> 01:12:13,360
that there were Communists
on the project.

1466
01:12:13,393 --> 01:12:15,161
We didn't knowingly
employ any Communists.

1467
01:12:15,195 --> 01:12:16,962
I just want to know,
were any of them involved

1468
01:12:16,995 --> 01:12:18,465
in discussions of the Super?

1469
01:12:18,498 --> 01:12:20,667
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

1470
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,968
My brother had left
the Party by then.

1471
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:24,237
What about Lomanitz?

1472
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:26,004
Lomanitz was never
employed at Los Alamos.

1473
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:27,040
He was a liaison.

1474
01:12:27,073 --> 01:12:28,241
Our security was tight,

1475
01:12:28,274 --> 01:12:29,642
as former Colonel Nichols
well knows.

1476
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:31,244
Our security was as tight
as it could be

1477
01:12:31,277 --> 01:12:32,645
given the personalities
involved,

1478
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:34,514
but attempts were made.

1479
01:12:34,547 --> 01:12:35,548
What is that supposed to mean?

1480
01:12:35,582 --> 01:12:37,150
We've all read his file here.

1481
01:12:38,184 --> 01:12:40,186
Do we need to talk
about Jean Tatlock?

1482
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,888
Or the Chevalier incident?

1483
01:12:47,494 --> 01:12:48,894
'Scuse me.

1484
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:54,167
That's Lomanitz, line one.

1485
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:01,074
Hello, Rossi.

1486
01:13:01,107 --> 01:13:04,310
<i>What? O-Okay, just calm down.</i>

1487
01:13:05,278 --> 01:13:08,515
There's been another screw-up.
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1488
01:13:08,548 --> 01:13:11,016
-We are at war, Doctor.
-Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1489
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:13,052
We need this kid.
Fix it, will you?

1490
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:14,287
It wasn't a mistake.

1491
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,655
Your friend Lomanitz
has been trying

1492
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:17,956
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1493
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:19,292
He promised to quit all that.

1494
01:13:19,325 --> 01:13:21,227
Well, he hasn't.

1495
01:13:21,261 --> 01:13:23,129
Security officer at Berkeley's
concerned about

1496
01:13:23,163 --> 01:13:25,465
Communist infiltration
through that union,

1497
01:13:25,498 --> 01:13:28,101
-the F.A...
-F.A.E.C.T.

1498
01:13:30,503 --> 01:13:34,207
While I'm there next week,
I'll drop in to see him.

1499
01:13:36,476 --> 01:13:38,211
Your Q clearance came through.

1500
01:13:41,748 --> 01:13:43,183
It's important
you not maintain or renew

1501
01:13:43,216 --> 01:13:45,485
any questionable associations.

1502
01:13:50,223 --> 01:13:52,725
<i>Doctor, did you think</i>
<i>social contacts</i>

1503
01:13:52,759 --> 01:13:55,094
between a person engaged
on secret war work

1504
01:13:55,128 --> 01:13:56,496
and Communists was dangerous?

1505
01:13:56,529 --> 01:14:00,200
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

1506
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:03,136
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

1507
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:06,372
<i>you felt that such contacts</i>
<i>were potentially dangerous.</i>

1508
01:14:12,812 --> 01:14:15,782
<i>Were conceivably dangerous, yes.</i>

1509
01:14:15,815 --> 01:14:18,084
<i>I mean, really,</i>

1510
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:20,153
<i>known Communists.</i>

1511
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:24,524
<i>Look...</i>

1512
01:14:24,557 --> 01:14:26,092
I've had a lot of secrets

1513
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:29,095
<i>in my head for a long time.</i>

1514
01:14:30,063 --> 01:14:31,331
<i>Doesn't matter</i>
<i>who I associate with.</i>

1515
01:14:31,364 --> 01:14:34,267
I don't talk about
those secrets.

1516
01:14:41,674 --> 01:14:43,309
You said in your statement

1517
01:14:43,343 --> 01:14:49,282
that you had to see
Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1518
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,418
You left.

1519
01:14:53,653 --> 01:14:55,088
Not a word.

1520
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:57,590
What did you think
that would do to me?

1521
01:14:58,691 --> 01:14:59,759
I wrote.

1522
01:14:59,792 --> 01:15:02,195
Pages of nothing.

1523
01:15:04,464 --> 01:15:06,799
Where did you go?

1524
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:09,269
-I can't tell you.
-Why not?

1525
01:15:09,302 --> 01:15:12,038
Because you're a Communist.

1526
01:15:13,573 --> 01:15:15,441
Why did you have to see her?

1527
01:15:15,475 --> 01:15:18,578
Because she had indicated
a great desire

1528
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:20,280
to see me before we left.

1529
01:15:20,313 --> 01:15:21,481
At that time, I couldn't,

1530
01:15:21,514 --> 01:15:25,318
but I felt that
she had to see me.

1531
01:15:25,351 --> 01:15:27,854
She was undergoing
psychiatric treatment.

1532
01:15:27,887 --> 01:15:30,123
She was extremely unhappy.

1533
01:15:30,156 --> 01:15:32,158
Did you find out
why she had to see you?

1534
01:15:37,263 --> 01:15:39,332
Because she was
still in love with me.

1535
01:15:46,539 --> 01:15:48,608
Spent the night together,
didn't you?

1536
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:57,617
Yes.

1537
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:07,160
You drop in and out of my life,

1538
01:16:07,193 --> 01:16:09,662
and you don't
have to tell me why.

1539
01:16:09,696 --> 01:16:11,164
Now that's power.

1540
01:16:11,197 --> 01:16:13,232
Not that I enjoy.

1541
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,336
I'd rather be here
for you as you need.

1542
01:16:16,369 --> 01:16:18,838
But you have
other priorities now.

1543
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:21,641
I have a wife and child.

1544
01:16:22,642 --> 01:16:25,445
That's not what either of us
is talking about.

1545
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:30,750
Jean.

1546
01:16:30,783 --> 01:16:32,919
You asked me to come.

1547
01:16:32,952 --> 01:16:35,321
And I'm glad I did.

1548
01:16:35,955 --> 01:16:38,524
But I can't see you again.

1549
01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:42,629
But what if I need you?

1550
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:49,168
You said you would
always answer.

1551
01:16:51,638 --> 01:16:52,772
Not a word?

1552
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:55,109
<i>Did you think that</i>
<i>consistent with good security?</i>

1553
01:16:55,141 --> 01:16:57,810
As a matter of fact, it was.

1554
01:16:57,844 --> 01:17:00,213
<i>Not a word.</i>

1555
01:17:00,246 --> 01:17:02,415
When did you
see her after that?

1556
01:17:10,823 --> 01:17:12,492
I never saw her again.

1557
01:17:18,698 --> 01:17:21,334
I can make the last train
back to Princeton.

1558
01:17:21,367 --> 01:17:24,537
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

1559
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:26,706
Today you said it to history,
didn't you?

1560
01:17:26,739 --> 01:17:28,274
This is a closed hearing.

1561
01:17:29,976 --> 01:17:31,577
If they don't release
the transcript,

1562
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:33,613
-I'm sure you will.
-I was under oath.

1563
01:17:33,646 --> 01:17:35,415
Well, you were
under an oath for me

1564
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:37,250
when you went to see Jean.

1565
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:39,352
You know, you...

1566
01:17:40,253 --> 01:17:42,555
...you sit there, day after day,

1567
01:17:42,588 --> 01:17:45,625
letting them pick our lives
to pieces.

1568
01:17:48,628 --> 01:17:50,329
Why won't you fight?

1569
01:17:53,466 --> 01:17:56,602
Robert, I'm not
putting her up there.

1570
01:18:01,741 --> 01:18:04,610
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor.
Please, take a seat.

1571
01:18:04,644 --> 01:18:08,247
No need, um, I just wanted
to check whether I should

1572
01:18:08,281 --> 01:18:10,450
talk to Lomanitz while I'm here,
given your concerns.

1573
01:18:10,483 --> 01:18:12,585
Well, I'd say that's really
up to you, Professor,

1574
01:18:12,618 --> 01:18:14,787
-but I'd be cautious.
-Uh-huh. Understood.

1575
01:18:14,821 --> 01:18:17,557
Oh, and, um,
as regards to the union,

1576
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:19,358
I wanted to give you
a heads-up on a...

1577
01:18:19,392 --> 01:18:20,727
on a man named Eltenton.

1578
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,261
A heads-up?

1579
01:18:22,295 --> 01:18:26,232
Yes, just that he might
merit watching is all.

1580
01:18:27,034 --> 01:18:28,468
Well, I'd love
to get more details.

1581
01:18:28,501 --> 01:18:30,837
Well, I...
I have an appointment now

1582
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:32,305
and I leave early tomorrow.

1583
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:33,873
Well, come back
as early as you like.

1584
01:18:33,906 --> 01:18:36,242
Since you haven't time now.

1585
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:38,745
You went back the next morning.

1586
01:18:38,778 --> 01:18:40,780
I did, I had to, really.

1587
01:18:41,714 --> 01:18:44,317
<i>This time, there was</i>
<i>another man.</i>

1588
01:18:44,984 --> 01:18:46,486
He said his name's Pash.

1589
01:18:46,519 --> 01:18:49,021
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1590
01:18:49,056 --> 01:18:50,590
Colonel Pash,
could you please read

1591
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:54,427
from your memo
dated June 29, 1943?

1592
01:18:56,529 --> 01:18:58,631
"Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

1593
01:18:58,664 --> 01:19:01,501
"indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

1594
01:19:01,534 --> 01:19:03,703
"Subject met with
and spent considerable time

1595
01:19:03,736 --> 01:19:05,938
"with one Jean Tatlock,
Communist,

1596
01:19:05,972 --> 01:19:07,440
the record of whom is attached."

1597
01:19:07,473 --> 01:19:09,342
The subject being
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1598
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:11,844
-Yes.
-Whom you had not met?

1599
01:19:11,878 --> 01:19:13,679
Not then, but soon after.

1600
01:19:13,713 --> 01:19:15,082
He's the head of security
for the project.

1601
01:19:15,115 --> 01:19:16,349
Shouldn't I know him?

1602
01:19:16,382 --> 01:19:17,717
No, he should know you.

1603
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,652
I would never put you
in a room with Pash.

1604
01:19:19,685 --> 01:19:20,953
Why not?

1605
01:19:20,987 --> 01:19:23,056
When Pash first heard
about Lomanitz,

1606
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:26,025
he told the FBI
he was gonna kidnap him,

1607
01:19:26,059 --> 01:19:27,527
take him out on a boat

1608
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,563
and interrogate him
in the Russian manner.

1609
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:35,535
General Groves has placed in me
a certain responsibility,

1610
01:19:35,568 --> 01:19:37,804
and it's like having a child
who I can't see.

1611
01:19:37,837 --> 01:19:39,939
-Ah.
-By remote control.

1612
01:19:39,972 --> 01:19:43,576
So to actually meet you is...

1613
01:19:44,677 --> 01:19:46,113
I won't take up
too much of your time.

1614
01:19:46,146 --> 01:19:48,414
No, no, not at all.
Whatever time you choose.

1615
01:19:48,447 --> 01:19:51,350
Mm. Mr. Johnson told me
of a conversation

1616
01:19:51,384 --> 01:19:53,120
you had yesterday
in which I'm very interested.

1617
01:19:53,153 --> 01:19:55,421
It's had me worried all day.

1618
01:19:55,454 --> 01:19:57,957
Yes, well, I didn't want
to talk to Lomanitz

1619
01:19:57,990 --> 01:19:59,525
without authorization.

1620
01:19:59,559 --> 01:20:00,760
That's not the particular
interest that I have.

1621
01:20:00,793 --> 01:20:02,762
It's something
a little bit more...

1622
01:20:03,796 --> 01:20:05,565
...well, in my opinion,
more serious.

1623
01:20:05,598 --> 01:20:08,534
Now, when the FBI pointed out
that such information

1624
01:20:08,568 --> 01:20:10,103
wouldn't be admissible in court,
Pash made it clear

1625
01:20:10,137 --> 01:20:13,906
he had no intention of leaving
any witness left to prosecute.

1626
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,508
Now, the FBI talked him down,

1627
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:17,110
but that's the man
you're dancing with.

1628
01:20:17,144 --> 01:20:19,846
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

1629
01:20:19,879 --> 01:20:22,582
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab.

1630
01:20:22,615 --> 01:20:26,519
A man attached
to the Soviet Consul

1631
01:20:26,552 --> 01:20:29,589
indicated,
through intermediate people,

1632
01:20:29,622 --> 01:20:31,158
to people on this project,

1633
01:20:31,191 --> 01:20:34,627
that he was in a position
to transmit information.

1634
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:37,496
Oh, why would anyone
on the project want to do that?

1635
01:20:38,931 --> 01:20:41,467
Frankly, I can see that
there might be an argument

1636
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,903
for the Commander-in-Chief
informing the Russians--

1637
01:20:43,936 --> 01:20:45,805
they're our allies after all--

1638
01:20:45,838 --> 01:20:48,741
but I don't like the idea of it
going out the back door.

1639
01:20:48,774 --> 01:20:51,510
It might not hurt
to be on the lookout for it.

1640
01:20:52,912 --> 01:20:54,081
And you said that to Pash?

1641
01:20:54,114 --> 01:20:55,615
I was trying to put it

1642
01:20:55,648 --> 01:20:58,484
in a context
of Russia's not Germany.

1643
01:20:58,517 --> 01:21:02,922
Boris Pash is the son
of a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1644
01:21:02,955 --> 01:21:06,459
Born here, but in 1918,
he went back to Russia

1645
01:21:06,492 --> 01:21:07,927
to fight the Bolsheviks.

1646
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,130
This is a man who has killed
Communists with his own hands.

1647
01:21:10,163 --> 01:21:13,633
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

1648
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:15,701
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

1649
01:21:15,735 --> 01:21:17,937
Would you be
a little more specific?

1650
01:21:20,806 --> 01:21:23,676
There's a man whose name
was mentioned to me

1651
01:21:23,709 --> 01:21:25,811
a couple of times. Eltenton.

1652
01:21:26,846 --> 01:21:29,949
Uh, I believe he's a chemist
who works at Shell.

1653
01:21:29,982 --> 01:21:32,518
He talked to a friend of his

1654
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:36,455
who's an acquaintance
of someone on the project.

1655
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:40,127
And you thought Pash
would be satisfied with that?

1656
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,695
I was attempting
to give them Eltenton

1657
01:21:42,728 --> 01:21:44,064
without opening a can of worms.

1658
01:21:44,097 --> 01:21:46,066
I told them
a cock-and-bull story.

1659
01:21:46,099 --> 01:21:47,633
Did you lie
to General Groves too?

1660
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:51,204
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

1661
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:52,672
Do you recall this conversation

1662
01:21:52,705 --> 01:21:55,108
about the Chevalier incident?

1663
01:21:55,142 --> 01:21:57,543
I've seen so many
versions of it. Um...

1664
01:21:57,576 --> 01:21:58,744
Wasn't confused before,

1665
01:21:58,778 --> 01:22:00,213
but I'm certainly
getting there now.

1666
01:22:00,247 --> 01:22:01,547
And what was your conclusion?

1667
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:03,950
That he was under
the influence of

1668
01:22:03,983 --> 01:22:06,852
the typical American
schoolboy attitude

1669
01:22:06,886 --> 01:22:10,489
that there's something wicked
about telling on a friend.

1670
01:22:10,523 --> 01:22:12,558
Well, now.

1671
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:15,027
Might we know through whom
the contact was made?

1672
01:22:15,062 --> 01:22:17,264
That would in... involve people

1673
01:22:17,297 --> 01:22:19,266
who are not to be
involved in this.

1674
01:22:19,299 --> 01:22:22,069
Is that someone
a member of the project?

1675
01:22:22,102 --> 01:22:26,639
A member of the faculty, yes,
but not in the project, no.

1676
01:22:26,672 --> 01:22:27,773
Ah.

1677
01:22:27,807 --> 01:22:29,575
So Eltenton made his approach

1678
01:22:29,608 --> 01:22:32,845
through a member of
the faculty here at Berkeley?

1679
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:37,050
As far as I know.
As far as I know, yes.

1680
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:39,719
But there-there may have been

1681
01:22:39,752 --> 01:22:42,488
more than one person involved.

1682
01:22:45,891 --> 01:22:49,096
Gentlemen, if I...
if I seem uncooperative,

1683
01:22:49,129 --> 01:22:52,065
I think you can understand
that's because of my insistence

1684
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:54,700
in not getting
innocent people into trouble.

1685
01:22:54,734 --> 01:22:56,535
<i>You're trying</i>
<i>to protect your friend.</i>

1686
01:22:56,569 --> 01:22:57,803
Who's protecting you?

1687
01:22:57,837 --> 01:22:59,239
Well, you could.

1688
01:22:59,272 --> 01:23:00,606
If you gave me the name.

1689
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,575
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1690
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:03,642
That's a mistake, Robert.

1691
01:23:03,676 --> 01:23:05,511
You need to volunteer this name.

1692
01:23:06,346 --> 01:23:08,014
<i>And did he give you the name?</i>

1693
01:23:08,048 --> 01:23:09,182
<i>He did.</i>

1694
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:10,683
-But not then, did he?
-No.

1695
01:23:10,716 --> 01:23:12,185
No. In fact, it was some
months later, wasn't it?

1696
01:23:12,219 --> 01:23:14,121
It was.

1697
01:23:14,154 --> 01:23:15,255
You see me as persistent.

1698
01:23:15,288 --> 01:23:17,023
Well, you are...

1699
01:23:17,057 --> 01:23:18,891
you are persistent,
but that is your job.

1700
01:23:18,924 --> 01:23:22,628
And-and my job is to protect
the people that work for me.

1701
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:24,663
Instead of us going
on certain steps,

1702
01:23:24,697 --> 01:23:26,799
which may come
to your attention...

1703
01:23:28,168 --> 01:23:29,935
...and be disturbing to you,

1704
01:23:29,969 --> 01:23:33,073
I would like to discuss
those with you first.

1705
01:23:33,106 --> 01:23:34,607
I'm not formulating a plan.

1706
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,976
I'll just have to digest
the whole thing.

1707
01:23:40,613 --> 01:23:43,316
<i>In the months</i>
<i>in between your interview</i>

1708
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:46,986
with Dr. Oppenheimer and his
eventual naming of Chevalier,

1709
01:23:47,019 --> 01:23:48,321
did you expend resources

1710
01:23:48,355 --> 01:23:49,822
trying to find the name
of the intermediary?

1711
01:23:49,855 --> 01:23:52,325
Considerable resources, yes.

1712
01:23:52,359 --> 01:23:54,593
Without the name, our job
was extremely difficult.

1713
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:56,063
And when did you
receive the name?

1714
01:23:56,096 --> 01:23:57,330
I was gone by the time

1715
01:23:57,364 --> 01:23:59,799
-Oppenheimer finally
offered it up. -Gone?

1716
01:23:59,832 --> 01:24:02,001
They felt my time would be
better spent in Europe

1717
01:24:02,035 --> 01:24:04,770
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

1718
01:24:04,804 --> 01:24:05,971
Who did?

1719
01:24:07,074 --> 01:24:08,808
General Groves.

1720
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:10,609
He transferred me to London.

1721
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,152
<i>It's a little early</i>
<i>for a Christmas party.</i>

1722
01:24:19,186 --> 01:24:21,188
Something's up.

1723
01:24:21,221 --> 01:24:23,256
Tolman's been away.

1724
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:24,990
Where?

1725
01:24:25,024 --> 01:24:26,592
Ruth won't tell.

1726
01:24:31,131 --> 01:24:32,132
Hey!

1727
01:24:36,303 --> 01:24:37,837
Come on, Ruthie.

1728
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,939
Can't tell me, who can you tell?

1729
01:24:39,972 --> 01:24:42,708
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

1730
01:24:42,741 --> 01:24:44,111
What makes you think
I know where he is anyway?

1731
01:24:44,144 --> 01:24:45,845
'Cause you do a pretty good job

1732
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:48,647
of knowing where Mr. Tolman is
when it counts.

1733
01:24:48,681 --> 01:24:50,217
Like now?

1734
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:53,686
Attention!

1735
01:24:56,889 --> 01:24:58,824
Early Christmas present
for you all.

1736
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:09,269
<i>The British pilots</i>
<i>put me in the bomb bay.</i>

1737
01:25:09,302 --> 01:25:11,304
Showed me the-the oxygen,
you know,

1738
01:25:11,338 --> 01:25:13,073
but I messed it up.

1739
01:25:13,106 --> 01:25:15,708
Uh, when they opened me up
in Scotland, I was unconscious.

1740
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:17,943
But I pretended
I'd been napping.

1741
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:20,347
Please enjoy your party.

1742
01:25:21,714 --> 01:25:23,015
Is it big enough?

1743
01:25:23,049 --> 01:25:24,317
To end the war?

1744
01:25:24,351 --> 01:25:27,254
To end all war.

1745
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:34,161
Uh, Heisenberg sought me out
in Copenhagen.

1746
01:25:34,194 --> 01:25:35,928
It was chilling,

1747
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:37,997
my old student
working for the Nazis.

1748
01:25:38,031 --> 01:25:41,934
He told me some things
to draw me out.

1749
01:25:42,835 --> 01:25:46,173
Sustained fission reactions
in uranium.

1750
01:25:46,206 --> 01:25:48,408
That sounds more like
a reactor than a bomb.

1751
01:25:48,441 --> 01:25:49,875
Did he mention
gaseous diffusion?

1752
01:25:49,909 --> 01:25:52,179
He seemed more focused
on heavy water.

1753
01:25:52,212 --> 01:25:53,913
As a moderator?

1754
01:25:53,946 --> 01:25:55,315
Yes, instead of graphite.

1755
01:25:58,351 --> 01:25:59,718
What?

1756
01:25:59,752 --> 01:26:01,921
He took a wrong turn.

1757
01:26:01,954 --> 01:26:04,424
We're ahead. And with you here
to help us, Niels.

1758
01:26:04,457 --> 01:26:06,725
Sorry, could you...

1759
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:09,695
could you give us a moment,
gentlemen?

1760
01:26:15,868 --> 01:26:18,405
I am not here to help, Robert.

1761
01:26:18,438 --> 01:26:20,340
I knew you could
do this without me.

1762
01:26:20,373 --> 01:26:21,474
Then why did you come?

1763
01:26:21,508 --> 01:26:22,942
To talk about after.

1764
01:26:22,975 --> 01:26:24,944
The power you're about to reveal

1765
01:26:24,977 --> 01:26:27,180
will forever outlive the Nazis.

1766
01:26:28,248 --> 01:26:29,848
And the world is not prepared.

1767
01:26:29,882 --> 01:26:31,284
"You could lift the stone

1768
01:26:31,318 --> 01:26:33,953
without being ready
for the snake that's revealed."

1769
01:26:33,986 --> 01:26:35,355
We have to make
the politicians understand,

1770
01:26:35,388 --> 01:26:37,490
this isn't a new weapon.

1771
01:26:37,524 --> 01:26:38,991
It's a new world.

1772
01:26:39,024 --> 01:26:42,395
I'll be out there
doing what I can, but you...

1773
01:26:42,429 --> 01:26:44,997
you're an American Prometheus.

1774
01:26:45,031 --> 01:26:47,267
The man who gave them the power

1775
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,336
to destroy themselves,

1776
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:51,003
and they'll respect that.

1777
01:26:51,037 --> 01:26:53,206
And your work really begins.

1778
01:26:57,143 --> 01:27:00,280
I'm sorry, Oppie,
but there's a call.

1779
01:27:01,414 --> 01:27:04,150
From San Francisco.

1780
01:27:10,423 --> 01:27:12,125
Robert!

1781
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:16,895
Robert?

1782
01:27:17,564 --> 01:27:20,133
Robert. Robert.

1783
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:22,369
God, what's the matter?

1784
01:27:22,402 --> 01:27:24,170
What happened?

1785
01:27:25,038 --> 01:27:26,972
Her father called.

1786
01:27:27,006 --> 01:27:29,142
They found her yesterday
in the bath.

1787
01:27:30,143 --> 01:27:31,278
Who?

1788
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:34,281
She'd taken pills.

1789
01:27:34,314 --> 01:27:36,216
<i>Left a note, not signed.</i>

1790
01:27:37,217 --> 01:27:38,184
She took barbiturates,

1791
01:27:38,218 --> 01:27:40,153
but there was chloral hydrate
in her blood.

1792
01:27:43,523 --> 01:27:44,857
There was a note.

1793
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:47,193
Jean Tatlock?

1794
01:27:52,965 --> 01:27:54,967
We were together.

1795
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,803
She said she needed me. I...

1796
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:02,841
I told her I... I wouldn't...

1797
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:04,511
I told her I couldn't...

1798
01:28:04,544 --> 01:28:06,212
No, it was... it was me.

1799
01:28:09,215 --> 01:28:11,318
You don't get to commit the sin

1800
01:28:11,351 --> 01:28:13,153
and then have us all
feel sorry for you

1801
01:28:13,186 --> 01:28:16,056
that it had consequences.

1802
01:28:18,124 --> 01:28:20,327
You pull yourself together.

1803
01:28:23,996 --> 01:28:26,132
You know,
people here depend on you.

1804
01:28:28,635 --> 01:28:30,103
Donald, would you like

1805
01:28:30,136 --> 01:28:31,204
to contribute here?
Please, help me out.

1806
01:28:31,237 --> 01:28:32,439
You're on your own, pal.

1807
01:28:32,472 --> 01:28:33,573
Bob, I'm not quitting my job

1808
01:28:33,606 --> 01:28:34,940
because plutonium
is radioactive.

1809
01:28:34,973 --> 01:28:36,509
We just don't know
what it might do

1810
01:28:36,543 --> 01:28:38,278
to the female
reproductive system...

1811
01:28:38,311 --> 01:28:40,213
Your reproductive system is more
exposed than mine, presumably.

1812
01:28:40,246 --> 01:28:43,116
Can we please? The implosion
device is nowhere.

1813
01:28:43,149 --> 01:28:44,551
Hey, you can't rush everything.

1814
01:28:44,584 --> 01:28:46,119
-Oppie, please.
-Well, there's rushing

1815
01:28:46,152 --> 01:28:47,953
and there's getting on
with it, so pick one.

1816
01:28:47,986 --> 01:28:49,988
Wait. Neddermeyer's
doing his job.

1817
01:28:50,022 --> 01:28:50,956
Teller's not helping.

1818
01:28:50,989 --> 01:28:52,525
You're not helping.

1819
01:28:52,559 --> 01:28:53,959
I've been asking
for calculations

1820
01:28:53,992 --> 01:28:55,128
on the implosion lenses
for weeks.

1821
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:56,629
The British can do it. Fuchs.

1822
01:28:56,663 --> 01:28:57,963
Absolutely.

1823
01:28:57,996 --> 01:28:59,366
It's your job, Teller.

1824
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:01,201
I'm engaged in research.

1825
01:29:01,234 --> 01:29:03,902
On a hydrogen bomb
we're not even building.

1826
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:13,380
I won't work for that man.

1827
01:29:15,148 --> 01:29:17,250
Let him go. He's a prima donna.

1828
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:19,519
I agree.
He should leave Los Alamos.

1829
01:29:19,552 --> 01:29:21,054
Okay.

1830
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:22,955
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.

1831
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:24,391
Seth, I'm putting you
on plutonium.

1832
01:29:24,424 --> 01:29:27,527
Lilli, you go work for Kisty.
Because he needs you.

1833
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:30,130
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1834
01:29:30,163 --> 01:29:32,532
I'm putting you exclusively
on the implosion device.

1835
01:29:32,565 --> 01:29:36,336
And no one is leaving
Los Alamos.

1836
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:52,552
-They won't let me leave.
-No.

1837
01:29:52,585 --> 01:29:54,187
I won't let you leave.

1838
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:58,158
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

1839
01:29:58,191 --> 01:30:01,327
Stay here,
research what you want.

1840
01:30:01,361 --> 01:30:03,962
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb,
whatever.

1841
01:30:03,996 --> 01:30:05,165
We'll meet to discuss.

1842
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:06,666
You don't have time to meet.

1843
01:30:06,699 --> 01:30:08,268
You're a politician now, Robert.

1844
01:30:08,301 --> 01:30:10,936
You've left physics behind
many, many years ago.

1845
01:30:11,771 --> 01:30:13,573
Once a week.

1846
01:30:13,606 --> 01:30:15,475
One hour. You and me.

1847
01:30:20,647 --> 01:30:23,216
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1848
01:30:27,153 --> 01:30:29,589
<i>So the Super</i>
<i>was under development</i>

1849
01:30:29,622 --> 01:30:31,591
<i>on your watch at Los Alamos?</i>

1850
01:30:31,624 --> 01:30:33,126
Yes.

1851
01:30:33,159 --> 01:30:35,027
And yet, after the war,

1852
01:30:35,061 --> 01:30:36,663
you tried to deny it was viable.

1853
01:30:36,696 --> 01:30:38,198
No, no, no. I...

1854
01:30:38,231 --> 01:30:40,066
I pointed out
technical difficulties with it.

1855
01:30:40,099 --> 01:30:41,734
You... Didn't you try
to kill it at the AEC meeting

1856
01:30:41,768 --> 01:30:43,336
-after the Russian bomb test?
-No.

1857
01:30:43,369 --> 01:30:45,472
But that was
the recommendation of the AEC,

1858
01:30:45,505 --> 01:30:47,774
-was it not?
-After hours of discussion

1859
01:30:47,807 --> 01:30:50,076
<i>about the best response.</i>

1860
01:30:50,109 --> 01:30:55,215
An H-bomb is 1,000 times
the power of an A-bomb.

1861
01:30:56,382 --> 01:31:00,153
Its only intended target
would be the largest cities.

1862
01:31:00,186 --> 01:31:02,288
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

1863
01:31:02,322 --> 01:31:04,624
Izzy, draw some circles
on this side of the map

1864
01:31:04,657 --> 01:31:06,292
where they would target us.

1865
01:31:06,326 --> 01:31:08,361
-Starting with New York. D.C.
-That's fair.

1866
01:31:08,394 --> 01:31:11,164
It's a weapon of attack
with no defensive value.

1867
01:31:11,197 --> 01:31:12,732
-Deterrence.
-"Deterrence"?

1868
01:31:12,765 --> 01:31:14,367
Do we really need
more deterrence

1869
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,803
than our current arsenal
of atomic bombs?

1870
01:31:16,836 --> 01:31:19,539
Y-You drown in ten feet
of water or-or 10,000,

1871
01:31:19,572 --> 01:31:21,241
what's the difference?

1872
01:31:21,274 --> 01:31:23,243
We can already drown Russia.
They know it.

1873
01:31:23,276 --> 01:31:25,545
-And now they can drown us.
-So we're just escalating...

1874
01:31:36,456 --> 01:31:39,292
As I said,
Teller's designs are still as

1875
01:31:39,325 --> 01:31:41,261
impractical as they were
during the war.

1876
01:31:41,294 --> 01:31:44,264
A hydrogen bomb can be made
to work, Oppie, you know that.

1877
01:31:44,297 --> 01:31:45,431
I don't believe we should commit

1878
01:31:45,465 --> 01:31:47,367
all our resources
to that chance.

1879
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,270
Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

1880
01:31:50,303 --> 01:31:52,505
Simply by limiting the spread
of atomic weapons

1881
01:31:52,539 --> 01:31:55,842
through international control
on nuclear energy.

1882
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:57,443
By which you mean
world government?

1883
01:31:57,477 --> 01:32:00,413
The United Nations
as Roosevelt intended.

1884
01:32:00,446 --> 01:32:03,349
Well, I... I asked what Truman
should do, right?

1885
01:32:03,383 --> 01:32:06,286
The world's changed,
it's not fascism but Communism

1886
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:07,787
that now threatens our survival.

1887
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:11,457
Lewis, do you understand,
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

1888
01:32:11,491 --> 01:32:14,360
the Russians will have no choice
but to build their own?

1889
01:32:14,394 --> 01:32:16,162
Could they be working
on one already?

1890
01:32:16,195 --> 01:32:18,698
Based on information gathered
from a spy at Los Alamos.

1891
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:20,199
No spy at Los Alamos.

1892
01:32:20,233 --> 01:32:21,301
-Gentlemen.
-There wasn't?

1893
01:32:21,334 --> 01:32:22,569
Let's not get sidetracked.

1894
01:32:22,602 --> 01:32:24,304
I say we use this moment

1895
01:32:24,337 --> 01:32:25,738
to gain concessions
from the Russians

1896
01:32:25,772 --> 01:32:28,841
by committing that we will not
build a hydrogen bomb.

1897
01:32:28,875 --> 01:32:30,510
Thereby revealing its existence.

1898
01:32:30,543 --> 01:32:32,545
Which you seem convinced
they already know.

1899
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:34,180
All right.

1900
01:32:34,213 --> 01:32:36,316
At this point, I'd like
the committee members

1901
01:32:36,349 --> 01:32:40,286
to meet in privacy to finalize
our recommendations.

1902
01:32:41,421 --> 01:32:43,423
I'm just not sure you want
to go down this road.

1903
01:32:43,456 --> 01:32:45,725
Lewis, with respect,
we are the advisory committee,

1904
01:32:45,758 --> 01:32:47,527
we will give them our advice.

1905
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,661
Good night.

1906
01:32:52,865 --> 01:32:57,136
Dr. Oppenheimer?
Hi. William Borden.

1907
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:58,504
Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy?

1908
01:32:58,538 --> 01:32:59,739
Oh, yes, yes.

1909
01:32:59,772 --> 01:33:01,407
During the war, I was a pilot.

1910
01:33:02,542 --> 01:33:05,278
One night,
flying back from a raid,

1911
01:33:05,311 --> 01:33:08,214
I saw an amazing sight
like a meteor.

1912
01:33:09,415 --> 01:33:12,185
<i>A V-2 rocket headed to England.</i>

1913
01:33:12,218 --> 01:33:14,220
I can't help but imagine
what it will be

1914
01:33:14,253 --> 01:33:18,157
for such an enemy rocket
to carry an atomic warhead.

1915
01:33:26,933 --> 01:33:28,267
Well, let's make sure
we're not the ones

1916
01:33:28,301 --> 01:33:29,602
to make that possible.

1917
01:33:36,309 --> 01:33:39,212
Oppie, I don't think you want
to go up against Strauss.

1918
01:33:39,245 --> 01:33:41,314
If we both speak,
they listen to me.

1919
01:33:41,347 --> 01:33:43,416
When you speak,
they hear a prophet.

1920
01:33:43,449 --> 01:33:45,418
When Strauss speaks,
they hear themselves.

1921
01:33:45,451 --> 01:33:47,253
They'll listen to a prophet.

1922
01:33:47,286 --> 01:33:50,556
A prophet can't be wrong.
Not once.

1923
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:52,358
<i>Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer</i>

1924
01:33:52,392 --> 01:33:54,293
<i>of sabotaging the development</i>
<i>of the Super?</i>

1925
01:33:54,327 --> 01:33:55,928
I was never one of those

1926
01:33:55,962 --> 01:33:59,232
to bandy around terms
like "sabotage."

1927
01:33:59,265 --> 01:34:01,234
<i>But Mr. Borden was?</i>

1928
01:34:01,267 --> 01:34:02,535
As I understand it, possibly.

1929
01:34:02,568 --> 01:34:04,671
How was Mr. Borden able
to put together

1930
01:34:04,704 --> 01:34:05,972
such a detailed indictment?

1931
01:34:06,005 --> 01:34:07,540
<i>He was no longer</i>
<i>a government employee,</i>

1932
01:34:07,573 --> 01:34:10,209
yet he appears to have
had unlimited access

1933
01:34:10,243 --> 01:34:11,744
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

1934
01:34:11,778 --> 01:34:14,681
<i>Might Mr. Nichols have</i>
<i>given him access to the file?</i>

1935
01:34:14,714 --> 01:34:16,616
Or someone else, at the AEC?

1936
01:34:16,649 --> 01:34:19,485
That's a very serious
accusation, Senator.

1937
01:34:19,519 --> 01:34:21,988
Is it your intention to
suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer

1938
01:34:22,021 --> 01:34:23,956
is disloyal
to the United States?

1939
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:26,526
I've always assumed,
and still assume,

1940
01:34:26,559 --> 01:34:29,262
that he's loyal
to the United States.

1941
01:34:29,295 --> 01:34:30,730
I believe this.
And I shall believe it

1942
01:34:30,763 --> 01:34:33,566
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

1943
01:34:33,599 --> 01:34:35,368
<i>Do you or do you not believe</i>

1944
01:34:35,401 --> 01:34:37,770
<i>that Dr. Oppenheimer</i>
<i>is a security risk?</i>

1945
01:34:45,978 --> 01:34:47,613
And if I may,

1946
01:34:47,647 --> 01:34:50,450
when Hitler blew
his brains out in that bunker,

1947
01:34:50,483 --> 01:34:52,018
it's my humble opinion
that there is no need

1948
01:34:52,052 --> 01:34:53,519
for that bomb
to be seen anywhere

1949
01:34:53,553 --> 01:34:55,321
except for that test site.

1950
01:34:55,354 --> 01:34:57,356
But we at least
have to take a moment

1951
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:59,392
to think about whether the means

1952
01:34:59,425 --> 01:35:01,694
justify the ends
any longer, because...

1953
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:06,599
Germany is about to surrender.

1954
01:35:08,501 --> 01:35:11,838
It's no longer the enemy
who are the greatest threat

1955
01:35:11,871 --> 01:35:13,673
to mankind, it's our work.

1956
01:35:16,076 --> 01:35:18,811
Hitler's dead, it's true.

1957
01:35:20,513 --> 01:35:22,049
But the Japanese fight on.

1958
01:35:22,082 --> 01:35:23,750
Their defeat seems assured.

1959
01:35:23,783 --> 01:35:26,786
Not if you're a G.I.
preparing to invade.

1960
01:35:28,088 --> 01:35:29,388
We can end this war.

1961
01:35:29,422 --> 01:35:30,823
But how do we justify

1962
01:35:30,857 --> 01:35:32,425
using this weapon
on human beings?

1963
01:35:35,461 --> 01:35:38,865
We're theorists, yes?

1964
01:35:38,898 --> 01:35:40,500
Yes. Yep.

1965
01:35:40,533 --> 01:35:44,570
We imagine a future
and our imaginings horrify us.

1966
01:35:45,638 --> 01:35:47,774
But they won't fear it
until they understand it,

1967
01:35:47,807 --> 01:35:50,710
and they won't understand it
until they've used it.

1968
01:35:50,743 --> 01:35:51,911
When the world learns

1969
01:35:51,944 --> 01:35:54,447
the terrible secret
of Los Alamos,

1970
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:57,917
our work here will ensure
a peace mankind has never seen.

1971
01:35:57,950 --> 01:36:01,320
A peace based on the kind
of international cooperation

1972
01:36:01,354 --> 01:36:03,389
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

1973
01:36:08,494 --> 01:36:09,729
<i>Progress?</i>

1974
01:36:09,762 --> 01:36:12,532
Two years and
a billion dollars' worth?

1975
01:36:12,565 --> 01:36:14,333
Well, hard to put a price on it.

1976
01:36:14,367 --> 01:36:15,935
Not really,
just add up the bills.

1977
01:36:15,968 --> 01:36:17,670
"Rural free deliveries."

1978
01:36:17,703 --> 01:36:20,473
Eighty babies delivered
the first year.

1979
01:36:20,506 --> 01:36:22,842
This year,
we've had ten a month.

1980
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:25,611
Birth control is a little out
of my jurisdiction, General.

1981
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:28,815
-Clearly.
-General.

1982
01:36:33,786 --> 01:36:35,122
Head down, everyone.

1983
01:36:35,155 --> 01:36:37,323
Fuchs, head down.

1984
01:36:39,826 --> 01:36:40,993
Hmm?

1985
01:36:43,863 --> 01:36:45,598
That's the one.

1986
01:36:45,631 --> 01:36:48,534
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

1987
01:36:50,837 --> 01:36:52,672
September.

1988
01:36:52,705 --> 01:36:53,706
July.

1989
01:36:53,739 --> 01:36:55,675
That's the sweet spot,
gentlemen.

1990
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:57,877
August.

1991
01:36:57,910 --> 01:36:59,645
July.

1992
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:01,480
Test in July.

1993
01:37:01,514 --> 01:37:03,150
But I need my brother.

1994
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,455
Frank knows the desert,
he's left politics behind,

1995
01:37:09,488 --> 01:37:11,924
he's been working with
Lawrence for two years now.

1996
01:37:18,898 --> 01:37:20,733
What do we call the test?

1997
01:37:21,834 --> 01:37:25,605
"Batter my heart,
three-person'd god."

1998
01:37:25,638 --> 01:37:26,739
What?

1999
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:29,508
Trinity.

2000
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:38,551
You insisted

2001
01:37:38,584 --> 01:37:39,886
on bringing on
your brother Frank,

2002
01:37:39,919 --> 01:37:41,520
-a known Communist.
-A former Communist.

2003
01:37:41,554 --> 01:37:43,990
You brought a known
former Communist

2004
01:37:44,023 --> 01:37:47,894
onto America's most secret
and important defense project.

2005
01:37:47,927 --> 01:37:51,030
I knew my brother
could be trusted. Absolutely.

2006
01:37:51,064 --> 01:37:53,033
And you felt
your judgment was sound

2007
01:37:53,066 --> 01:37:54,901
on who on the team
could be trusted?

2008
01:37:55,902 --> 01:37:57,037
Fuchs, head down.

2009
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:58,804
Okay, everybody ready?

2010
01:38:00,173 --> 01:38:02,109
Hmm?

2011
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:03,910
Oh.

2012
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,181
Oh.

2013
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:09,949
Well, I hope
you learned something.

2014
01:38:09,982 --> 01:38:11,884
Yeah, we learned we're gonna
need to be a lot further away.

2015
01:38:11,918 --> 01:38:13,486
Well, figure it out. Fast.

2016
01:38:13,519 --> 01:38:15,188
We leave for Washington
in the morning.

2017
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:17,423
We're gonna give them a date.

2018
01:38:31,570 --> 01:38:33,240
You're a long way
from Chicago, Leo.

2019
01:38:33,273 --> 01:38:34,774
If we don't act now,

2020
01:38:34,807 --> 01:38:36,509
they're going to use
this thing against Japan.

2021
01:38:36,542 --> 01:38:38,511
We booked a meeting with Truman,

2022
01:38:38,544 --> 01:38:39,812
but somebody killed it.

2023
01:38:39,845 --> 01:38:41,714
You're meeting
the Secretary of War.

2024
01:38:41,747 --> 01:38:43,916
Just because we're building it,

2025
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:45,952
doesn't mean we get to decide
how it's used.

2026
01:38:45,985 --> 01:38:48,754
History will judge us, Robert.

2027
01:38:48,788 --> 01:38:52,092
In Chicago,
we put together a petition.

2028
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:54,061
I'm not...
I'm not getting into that.

2029
01:38:59,132 --> 01:39:01,068
Just tell me your concerns,
and I'll relay them.

2030
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:02,202
My concerns?

2031
01:39:02,235 --> 01:39:04,204
Germany's defeated.

2032
01:39:04,237 --> 01:39:06,005
Japan's not going
to hold out alone.

2033
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:07,940
How could you know that?
You got us into this.

2034
01:39:07,974 --> 01:39:09,742
You and Einstein
with your letter to Roosevelt

2035
01:39:09,775 --> 01:39:12,578
-saying we could build a bomb.
-Against Germany.

2036
01:39:12,611 --> 01:39:15,548
That's not how weapons
manufacture works, Szilard.

2037
01:39:15,581 --> 01:39:16,716
Oppie, you have to help.

2038
01:39:16,749 --> 01:39:18,051
Fermi's in the meeting.

2039
01:39:18,085 --> 01:39:19,652
-Lawrence is in the meeting.
-They're not you.

2040
01:39:19,685 --> 01:39:21,854
You're the great salesman
of science.

2041
01:39:21,887 --> 01:39:24,490
You can convince
anyone of anything.

2042
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:26,592
Even yourself.

2043
01:39:27,194 --> 01:39:28,594
'Scuse me.

2044
01:39:29,628 --> 01:39:32,898
The firestorm in Tokyo killed
100,000 people.

2045
01:39:32,932 --> 01:39:34,734
Mostly civilians.

2046
01:39:34,767 --> 01:39:37,304
I worry about an America
where we do these things

2047
01:39:37,337 --> 01:39:39,072
and no one protests.

2048
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:42,142
Pearl Harbor and three years of
brutal conflict in the Pacific

2049
01:39:42,175 --> 01:39:44,710
bought us a lot of latitude
with the American public.

2050
01:39:44,744 --> 01:39:46,779
Enough to unleash
the atomic bomb?

2051
01:39:46,812 --> 01:39:48,681
Uh, the A-bomb might not cause

2052
01:39:48,714 --> 01:39:50,616
as much damage
as the Tokyo bombings.

2053
01:39:50,649 --> 01:39:52,018
What are we estimating?

2054
01:39:52,052 --> 01:39:54,887
In a medium-size city, uh,

2055
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,323
20 or 30,000 dead.

2056
01:39:56,356 --> 01:39:58,158
Yes, but, uh,

2057
01:39:58,191 --> 01:40:01,228
don't underestimate
the psychological impact of a...

2058
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:02,661
of an atomic explosion.

2059
01:40:02,695 --> 01:40:06,932
A pillar of fire
10,000 feet tall.

2060
01:40:06,966 --> 01:40:10,303
Deadly neutron effects
for a mile, in all directions,

2061
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:13,240
from one single device.

2062
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:15,608
Dropped from
a barely noticed B-29,

2063
01:40:15,641 --> 01:40:17,910
the atomic bomb will be

2064
01:40:17,943 --> 01:40:20,780
a terrible revelation
of divine power.

2065
01:40:20,813 --> 01:40:24,084
If that's true,
it would be definitive.

2066
01:40:24,117 --> 01:40:26,186
World War II would be over.

2067
01:40:26,219 --> 01:40:27,920
Our boys would come home.

2068
01:40:27,953 --> 01:40:29,089
Military targets?

2069
01:40:30,223 --> 01:40:32,892
Uh, there aren't any big enough.

2070
01:40:32,925 --> 01:40:38,697
Perhaps a vital war plant
with workers housed nearby.

2071
01:40:38,731 --> 01:40:41,068
And we could issue a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

2072
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:43,270
They'd send everything
they have up against us,

2073
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:44,904
and I'd be up in that plane.

2074
01:40:44,937 --> 01:40:48,141
But if we announce it
and it fails to go off,

2075
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:50,876
we'd scupper any chance
of a Japanese surrender.

2076
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:54,013
Is there no way to demonstrate
a bomb to Japan

2077
01:40:54,047 --> 01:40:55,748
to provoke surrender?

2078
01:40:55,781 --> 01:40:58,851
We intend to demonstrate it
in the most unambiguous terms.

2079
01:40:58,884 --> 01:40:59,585
Twice.

2080
01:40:59,618 --> 01:41:01,687
Once to show the weapon's power

2081
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,224
and a second to show
that we can keep doing this

2082
01:41:04,257 --> 01:41:05,758
until they surrender.

2083
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:09,162
We have a list of 12 cities
to choose from...

2084
01:41:09,196 --> 01:41:11,098
Sorry, 11.

2085
01:41:11,131 --> 01:41:12,832
I've taken Kyoto off the list

2086
01:41:12,865 --> 01:41:16,669
due to its cultural significance
to the Japanese people.

2087
01:41:16,702 --> 01:41:19,339
Also, my wife and I
honeymooned there.

2088
01:41:19,372 --> 01:41:20,873
It's a magnificent city.

2089
01:41:24,444 --> 01:41:26,146
Let me make this
simple for you, gentlemen.

2090
01:41:26,179 --> 01:41:28,681
According to my intelligence,
which I cannot share with you,

2091
01:41:28,714 --> 01:41:31,151
the Japanese people
will not surrender

2092
01:41:31,184 --> 01:41:32,952
under any circumstances

2093
01:41:32,985 --> 01:41:36,389
short of a successful and total
invasion of the home islands.

2094
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:39,392
Many lives will be lost,
American and Japanese.

2095
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:41,660
The use of the atomic bomb
on Japanese cities

2096
01:41:41,694 --> 01:41:43,662
will save lives.

2097
01:41:43,696 --> 01:41:45,998
If we retain moral advantage.

2098
01:41:46,032 --> 01:41:48,168
-How so?
-Well, if we use this weapon

2099
01:41:48,201 --> 01:41:51,138
without informing our allies,
they'll see it as a threat.

2100
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:52,339
And we'll be in an arms race.

2101
01:41:52,372 --> 01:41:54,441
How open can we be
with the Soviets?

2102
01:41:54,474 --> 01:41:56,042
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets

2103
01:41:56,076 --> 01:41:58,445
from becoming part
of the atomic world.

2104
01:41:58,478 --> 01:42:00,779
We've been told
they have no uranium.

2105
01:42:00,813 --> 01:42:02,014
You've been misinformed.

2106
01:42:02,048 --> 01:42:03,883
A Russian bomb
is a matter of time.

2107
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:07,320
The program needs to continue
at full pace after the war.

2108
01:42:07,354 --> 01:42:09,955
Uh, Secretary Stimson,
if I may...

2109
01:42:09,989 --> 01:42:13,993
Not all scientists
on the project are in agreement.

2110
01:42:14,026 --> 01:42:16,896
In fact, this might be a moment
to consider other opinions.

2111
01:42:16,929 --> 01:42:18,831
-If you talk a scientist in...
-The Manhattan Project

2112
01:42:18,864 --> 01:42:20,233
has been plagued from the start

2113
01:42:20,267 --> 01:42:24,070
by certain scientists
of doubtful discretion

2114
01:42:24,104 --> 01:42:25,172
and uncertain loyalty.

2115
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:27,440
One of them just tried to meet
with the president.

2116
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:29,309
Now, we need these men,

2117
01:42:29,342 --> 01:42:30,876
but as soon as it's practical,

2118
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:33,180
we should sever any such
scientists from the program.

2119
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:34,780
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

2120
01:42:35,915 --> 01:42:37,750
If a Russian bomb
is inevitable,

2121
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:41,054
perhaps we should invite
their top scientists to Trinity.

2122
01:42:41,087 --> 01:42:43,390
President Truman
has no intention

2123
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:44,990
of raising expectations

2124
01:42:45,024 --> 01:42:47,826
that Stalin be included
in the atomic project.

2125
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:49,229
Informing him
of our breakthrough

2126
01:42:49,262 --> 01:42:50,863
and presenting it as a means
to win the war

2127
01:42:50,896 --> 01:42:53,799
need not make
unkeepable promises.

2128
01:42:53,832 --> 01:42:55,368
But the Potsdam
peace conference in July

2129
01:42:55,402 --> 01:42:57,304
will be President Truman's
last chance

2130
01:42:57,337 --> 01:42:59,472
to have that conversation.

2131
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:01,408
Can you give us
a working bomb by then?

2132
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:06,112
Absolutely. We will test fire
before the conference.

2133
01:43:10,849 --> 01:43:13,386
<i>Ground zero observation posts</i>

2134
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,887
<i>at 10,000 yards</i>

2135
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,090
north, south and west.

2136
01:43:17,123 --> 01:43:20,427
-Where do we trigger from?
-Uh, south 10,000.

2137
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:23,796
And base camp
is ten miles south, here.

2138
01:43:23,829 --> 01:43:26,765
And there's a further
observation post

2139
01:43:26,799 --> 01:43:28,968
on-on that hill 20 miles away.

2140
01:43:29,001 --> 01:43:31,971
What's that, Frank?
Trigger lines already went in.

2141
01:43:32,004 --> 01:43:35,508
The Air Force requested
a line of lights for their B-29.

2142
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:37,977
What B-29?
Our bomb's on the tower.

2143
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:39,379
They want to use the test

2144
01:43:39,412 --> 01:43:41,248
to confirm a safe
operating distance.

2145
01:43:41,281 --> 01:43:42,515
That's risky.

2146
01:43:42,549 --> 01:43:44,184
Not as risky as dropping one
over Japan

2147
01:43:44,217 --> 01:43:45,985
and hoping that we were right
about the blast radius.

2148
01:43:46,018 --> 01:43:48,121
Don't let them slow us down,
we're firing on the 15th.

2149
01:43:48,154 --> 01:43:51,391
-The 15th? That's not...
-The 15th.

2150
01:43:51,424 --> 01:43:53,759
The 15th.

2151
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:56,795
So I'll be here
at South Observation point

2152
01:43:56,829 --> 01:43:59,032
<i>with Frank and Kistiakowsky.</i>

2153
01:43:59,065 --> 01:44:01,568
You'll all be assigned
to Base Camp,

2154
01:44:01,601 --> 01:44:04,803
West Observation
or Far Observation.

2155
01:44:14,447 --> 01:44:16,349
Whoa, whoa.
Careful with the knife.

2156
01:44:16,383 --> 01:44:18,817
There, carefully.

2157
01:44:19,918 --> 01:44:21,454
Are those safe distances?

2158
01:44:21,488 --> 01:44:23,989
They're based
on your calculations.

2159
01:44:24,023 --> 01:44:26,925
Time to stand behind
your science, Hans. Literally.

2160
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:51,817
Yeah.

2161
01:44:56,489 --> 01:44:58,325
What 'bout the radiation cloud?

2162
01:44:58,358 --> 01:44:59,592
Without high winds,

2163
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:01,194
it should settle
within two to three miles.

2164
01:45:01,227 --> 01:45:03,630
Evacuation measures
are in place.

2165
01:45:03,663 --> 01:45:05,465
But we need good weather
for visibility,

2166
01:45:05,498 --> 01:45:06,965
so it has to be fine.

2167
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:09,336
Everybody out.

2168
01:45:19,512 --> 01:45:20,647
We go on the night of the 15th.

2169
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,615
It's a hard deadline,

2170
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:25,951
so if anyone has anything,
speak now.

2171
01:45:26,653 --> 01:45:27,986
Okay, stop, stop.

2172
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:29,888
Everybody, mattresses.

2173
01:45:29,922 --> 01:45:31,990
Put the mattress underneath.

2174
01:45:48,974 --> 01:45:51,877
Could use
a final implosion test.

2175
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:54,547
It couldn't hurt.

2176
01:45:54,581 --> 01:45:56,082
Do it.

2177
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:59,352
Is there anything else
that might stop us?

2178
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:36,356
It's happening, isn't it?

2179
01:46:37,457 --> 01:46:39,225
I'll send a message.

2180
01:46:40,093 --> 01:46:42,729
If it's gone our way,

2181
01:46:42,762 --> 01:46:44,330
take in the sheets.

2182
01:46:48,368 --> 01:46:49,402
Robert?

2183
01:46:52,071 --> 01:46:53,506
Break a leg.

2184
01:48:00,073 --> 01:48:03,209
Oppie's taken a very modest
three kilotons.

2185
01:48:03,243 --> 01:48:05,612
-Teller's in with 45.
-20.

2186
01:48:05,645 --> 01:48:08,081
Twenty thousand tons of TNT,

2187
01:48:08,114 --> 01:48:09,516
and does anyone want
the side action

2188
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:12,285
on atmospheric ignition?

2189
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:16,189
Are you saying
we'll have to delay?

2190
01:48:16,222 --> 01:48:17,390
I'm saying it would be prudent.

2191
01:48:17,423 --> 01:48:18,658
This weather,
has it reached the site?

2192
01:48:24,497 --> 01:48:26,466
Bethe is calling to tell you
the implosion test failed.

2193
01:48:26,499 --> 01:48:28,134
Hello, Hans.

2194
01:48:28,167 --> 01:48:29,569
Yes, he's here.

2195
01:48:30,403 --> 01:48:31,738
Yes.

2196
01:48:34,307 --> 01:48:35,508
-Is he wrong?
-No.

2197
01:48:35,542 --> 01:48:37,443
-No?
-No.

2198
01:48:38,278 --> 01:48:39,846
So we're about to fire a dud?

2199
01:48:39,879 --> 01:48:41,347
-No.
-Explain.

2200
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:44,150
Well, I can't. I just...
I-I just know.

2201
01:48:44,183 --> 01:48:45,852
I know the implosion lenses
will work.

2202
01:48:45,885 --> 01:48:47,287
If we fire these detonators

2203
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,555
and they don't
trigger a reaction,

2204
01:48:48,588 --> 01:48:50,256
two years' worth of plutonium

2205
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:51,691
will be scattered
across White Sands.

2206
01:48:51,724 --> 01:48:55,628
A month of my salary against
ten bucks says it lights.

2207
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:57,664
Jesus.

2208
01:49:02,735 --> 01:49:05,872
The wind's picking
up at zero, not the rain.

2209
01:49:05,905 --> 01:49:07,340
Lightning's circling.

2210
01:49:07,373 --> 01:49:08,808
You think it might be time
to tell your men

2211
01:49:08,841 --> 01:49:11,744
to get away from the steel tower
with the atomic bomb?

2212
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:16,849
Let's get to South Observation.

2213
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:18,351
Pull 'em out.

2214
01:49:18,384 --> 01:49:19,786
We can make
our determination there.

2215
01:49:25,191 --> 01:49:27,193
The team hasn't slept
in two nights.

2216
01:49:27,226 --> 01:49:29,228
If we stand down,
make the bomb safe,

2217
01:49:29,262 --> 01:49:30,597
we won't be back here for weeks.

2218
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:32,298
Then we'll miss Potsdam.

2219
01:49:32,332 --> 01:49:34,233
I gotta get word
to Truman by 7:00.

2220
01:49:34,267 --> 01:49:35,501
Our window's closing.

2221
01:49:35,535 --> 01:49:36,603
What is this doing?

2222
01:49:36,636 --> 01:49:38,137
Raining, blowing, lightning.

2223
01:49:38,171 --> 01:49:40,206
-For how long, damn it?
-It's holdin' strong.

2224
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:41,541
It'll break before dawn.

2225
01:49:41,574 --> 01:49:43,242
-How could you know that?
-I know this desert.

2226
01:49:43,276 --> 01:49:44,377
Storm cools overnight.

2227
01:49:44,410 --> 01:49:46,212
Just before dawn,
the storm breaks.

2228
01:49:46,245 --> 01:49:48,448
He could be right, but schedule
as late as possible.

2229
01:49:48,481 --> 01:49:50,216
5:30!

2230
01:49:50,249 --> 01:49:51,284
Sign your forecast.

2231
01:49:51,317 --> 01:49:52,385
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

2232
01:49:52,418 --> 01:49:54,220
Frank, tell them all, 5:30.

2233
01:49:54,253 --> 01:49:56,389
-5:30, 5:30.
-5:30.

2234
01:49:58,591 --> 01:50:03,529
Three years,
4,000 people, $2 billion.

2235
01:50:03,563 --> 01:50:05,932
Well, if it doesn't go off...

2236
01:50:05,965 --> 01:50:07,567
we're both finished.

2237
01:50:10,336 --> 01:50:12,305
I'm betting on three kilotons.

2238
01:50:13,272 --> 01:50:14,707
Anything less,
they won't get what it is.

2239
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:19,312
What did Fermi mean
by "atmospheric ignition"?

2240
01:50:19,345 --> 01:50:20,813
Well, we had a moment
where it looked like

2241
01:50:20,847 --> 01:50:24,684
the chain reaction from an
atomic device might never stop.

2242
01:50:25,918 --> 01:50:27,954
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

2243
01:50:27,987 --> 01:50:29,956
Why is Fermi
still taking side bets on it?

2244
01:50:29,989 --> 01:50:33,159
Call it gallows humor.

2245
01:50:35,495 --> 01:50:38,297
Wait, are we saying
there's a chance

2246
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:40,199
that when we push that button,

2247
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:41,567
we destroy the world?

2248
01:50:41,601 --> 01:50:43,770
Nothing in our research
over three years

2249
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:45,438
supports that conclusion.

2250
01:50:45,471 --> 01:50:48,441
Except as the most
remote possibility.

2251
01:50:48,474 --> 01:50:49,809
How remote?

2252
01:50:49,842 --> 01:50:51,444
Chances are near zero.

2253
01:50:52,779 --> 01:50:54,180
Near zero?

2254
01:50:54,947 --> 01:50:57,517
What do you want
from theory alone?

2255
01:50:59,018 --> 01:51:01,387
Zero would be nice.

2256
01:51:04,691 --> 01:51:06,325
In exactly

2257
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:09,662
one hour, 58 minutes,

2258
01:51:09,696 --> 01:51:11,230
we'll know.

2259
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:18,471
It's letting up.

2260
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:33,720
The arming party's left Zero,
they're heading this way.

2261
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:34,721
Throwing the switches.

2262
01:51:34,754 --> 01:51:35,855
Turn the cars.

2263
01:51:35,888 --> 01:51:38,357
Ready for emergency evacuation.

2264
01:51:56,043 --> 01:51:57,276
...welder's glass.

2265
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,878
Everybody take your places.

2266
01:51:58,911 --> 01:52:01,414
Everybody take a welder's glass.

2267
01:52:02,915 --> 01:52:04,784
Everybody take a welder's glass.

2268
01:52:56,002 --> 01:52:57,403
Twenty minutes.

2269
01:53:00,907 --> 01:53:02,742
Twenty minutes.

2270
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,454
That's 20.

2271
01:53:18,457 --> 01:53:19,926
On the leg, please.

2272
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:23,963
-Feynman.
-No.

2273
01:53:23,996 --> 01:53:25,965
The glass. Stops the U.V.

2274
01:53:25,998 --> 01:53:27,800
And what stops the glass?

2275
01:53:28,801 --> 01:53:31,771
I'm gonna head to base camp.
Best of luck.

2276
01:53:32,905 --> 01:53:34,440
Robert.

2277
01:53:35,042 --> 01:53:36,876
Try not to blow up the world.

2278
01:53:48,754 --> 01:53:49,856
Watch that needle.

2279
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:51,457
If the detonators don't charge

2280
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:53,426
or the voltage drops
below one volt,

2281
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:55,461
you hit that button, you abort.

2282
01:53:55,494 --> 01:53:57,797
-Understood?
-Understood.

2283
01:54:05,205 --> 01:54:07,740
Two minutes to detonation.

2284
01:54:07,773 --> 01:54:09,742
Everybody down.

2285
01:54:09,775 --> 01:54:10,743
Do not turn around

2286
01:54:10,776 --> 01:54:13,846
until you see light
reflected on the hills.

2287
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:15,014
Then look at the explosion

2288
01:54:15,048 --> 01:54:16,682
only through
your welder's glass.

2289
01:54:16,716 --> 01:54:19,418
Ninety seconds to detonation.

2290
01:54:21,054 --> 01:54:23,890
Ninety seconds to detonation.

2291
01:54:23,923 --> 01:54:26,025
Is it rubbed in?

2292
01:54:26,059 --> 01:54:27,426
Yeah.

2293
01:54:33,766 --> 01:54:36,869
Sixty seconds to detonation.

2294
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:53,786
These things are hard
on your heart.

2295
01:54:53,819 --> 01:54:55,521
Thirty seconds.

2296
01:55:00,626 --> 01:55:02,028
Detonators charged.

2297
01:55:12,172 --> 01:55:15,641
Seventeen, sixteen,

2298
01:55:15,675 --> 01:55:16,842
fifteen,

2299
01:55:16,876 --> 01:55:18,045
fourteen,

2300
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:19,879
thirteen,

2301
01:55:19,912 --> 01:55:22,082
twelve,

2302
01:55:22,115 --> 01:55:23,783
eleven,

2303
01:55:23,816 --> 01:55:25,785
ten,

2304
01:55:25,818 --> 01:55:28,221
nine,

2305
01:55:28,255 --> 01:55:30,223
eight,

2306
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:32,825
seven,

2307
01:55:32,858 --> 01:55:35,228
six...

2308
01:55:35,262 --> 01:55:36,729
...five...

2309
01:55:38,731 --> 01:55:41,201
...four...

2310
01:55:41,234 --> 01:55:43,170
three...

2311
01:55:43,203 --> 01:55:44,737
two...

2312
01:55:46,039 --> 01:55:47,107
...one.

2313
01:56:08,627 --> 01:56:10,563
Poof.

2314
01:57:19,366 --> 01:57:22,735
<i>"And now I am become Death.</i>

2315
01:57:24,637 --> 01:57:26,806
<i>The destroyer of worlds."</i>

2316
01:57:59,805 --> 01:58:01,174
It worked.

2317
01:58:36,409 --> 01:58:38,411
-You owe me ten dollars!
-Oh!

2318
01:58:40,746 --> 01:58:41,881
-Come on!
-Hang on.

2319
01:58:41,914 --> 01:58:43,350
I'm good for it, Kisty.

2320
01:58:43,383 --> 01:58:45,684
You are.

2321
01:58:45,718 --> 01:58:48,421
Yes, you are!

2322
01:59:12,512 --> 01:59:14,047
Well done.

2323
01:59:15,748 --> 01:59:18,285
We did it! We did it!

2324
01:59:18,318 --> 01:59:20,220
Well done.

2325
01:59:25,024 --> 01:59:26,859
-Get me Potsdam right away.
-Yes, sir.

2326
01:59:38,338 --> 01:59:40,106
Get a message to Kitty.

2327
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:40,839
We can't say anything.

2328
01:59:40,873 --> 01:59:42,808
Tell her to take in the sheets.

2329
01:59:50,816 --> 01:59:52,352
We did it, everyone!

2330
01:59:57,224 --> 01:59:59,024
Hello?

2331
01:59:59,059 --> 02:00:01,494
-Hi, Kitty?
-What, what? Charlotte...

2332
02:00:01,528 --> 02:00:02,895
Charlotte, go ahead, go ahead.

2333
02:00:02,928 --> 02:00:04,297
Oh, um, well, I don't know,

2334
02:00:04,331 --> 02:00:07,534
he just said to tell you
to "bring in the sheets."

2335
02:00:10,237 --> 02:00:11,804
Kitty?

2336
02:00:12,905 --> 02:00:15,342
Kitty?
Kitty, are you still there?

2337
02:00:22,249 --> 02:00:24,384
<i>If they detonate it</i>
<i>too high in the air,</i>

2338
02:00:24,417 --> 02:00:25,784
the blast won't be as powerful.

2339
02:00:25,818 --> 02:00:27,853
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2340
02:00:27,886 --> 02:00:29,922
we'll take it from here.

2341
02:00:40,166 --> 02:00:43,069
Did Truman brief Stalin
at Potsdam?

2342
02:00:43,103 --> 02:00:45,838
A brief would be
an overstatement.

2343
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:49,942
He referred
to a powerful new weapon.

2344
02:00:49,975 --> 02:00:55,048
Stalin hoped we'd use it
against Japan.

2345
02:00:56,283 --> 02:00:58,017
That's it?

2346
02:00:58,051 --> 02:01:01,288
Robert, we've given them an ace,
it's for them to play the hand.

2347
02:01:03,423 --> 02:01:05,525
You're aiming for the 6th?

2348
02:01:05,558 --> 02:01:07,860
It's up to the CO
in the Pacific.

2349
02:01:09,195 --> 02:01:11,264
Shall I come with you
to Washington?

2350
02:01:12,865 --> 02:01:14,100
What for?

2351
02:01:16,369 --> 02:01:17,970
Well, you'll keep me informed.

2352
02:01:19,306 --> 02:01:20,939
Of course.

2353
02:01:22,509 --> 02:01:24,110
As best I can.

2354
02:01:41,528 --> 02:01:44,397
Would the Japanese surrender
if they knew what was coming?

2355
02:01:45,632 --> 02:01:47,233
I don't know.

2356
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:51,638
Have you seen
Szilard's petition?

2357
02:01:51,671 --> 02:01:54,407
What the hell does Szilard
know about the Japanese?

2358
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:55,642
You're not signing it, are you?

2359
02:01:55,675 --> 02:01:59,079
Many people have.
A lot of people have.

2360
02:01:59,112 --> 02:02:00,246
Edward.

2361
02:02:01,514 --> 02:02:03,183
The fact that we built this bomb

2362
02:02:03,216 --> 02:02:06,219
does not give us any more...
any more right or responsibility

2363
02:02:06,252 --> 02:02:08,355
to decide how it's used
than anyone else.

2364
02:02:08,388 --> 02:02:10,390
But we're the only people
who know about it.

2365
02:02:10,423 --> 02:02:13,992
I've told Stimson the various
opinions of the community.

2366
02:02:14,026 --> 02:02:15,428
But what's your opinion?

2367
02:02:16,663 --> 02:02:18,198
Once it's used...

2368
02:02:19,299 --> 02:02:23,001
...nuclear war,
perhaps all war...

2369
02:02:24,604 --> 02:02:26,039
...becomes unthinkable.

2370
02:02:26,072 --> 02:02:29,075
Until somebody
builds a bigger bomb.

2371
02:02:49,662 --> 02:02:51,398
I thought they would call.

2372
02:02:51,431 --> 02:02:52,998
It's only the 5th.

2373
02:02:55,168 --> 02:02:57,170
In Japan, it's the 6th.

2374
02:03:10,316 --> 02:03:11,317
Charlotte.

2375
02:03:13,653 --> 02:03:15,355
Try Groves.

2376
02:03:16,356 --> 02:03:17,424
<i>Anything?</i>

2377
02:03:19,726 --> 02:03:21,094
Charlotte?

2378
02:03:21,127 --> 02:03:22,429
Truman's on the radio.

2379
02:03:23,363 --> 02:03:26,266
Sixteen hours ago,

2380
02:03:26,299 --> 02:03:32,205
an American airplane dropped
one bomb on Hiroshima...

2381
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:36,376
...and destroyed its usefulness
to the enemy.

2382
02:03:38,344 --> 02:03:44,217
The bomb had more power
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

2383
02:03:45,685 --> 02:03:48,154
It is an atomic bomb.

2384
02:03:51,357 --> 02:03:52,725
It is a harnessing

2385
02:03:52,759 --> 02:03:55,528
of the basic powers
of the universe.

2386
02:03:57,564 --> 02:03:59,199
<i>Groves on one.</i>

2387
02:03:59,232 --> 02:04:02,268
We are now prepared
to destroy more rapidly

2388
02:04:02,302 --> 02:04:04,604
and completely the Japanese...

2389
02:04:04,637 --> 02:04:06,306
General?

2390
02:04:06,339 --> 02:04:09,375
I'm very proud of you
and all of your people.

2391
02:04:09,409 --> 02:04:10,743
It went all right?

2392
02:04:10,777 --> 02:04:13,746
Apparently, it went
with a tremendous bang.

2393
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:15,415
Well,

2394
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:18,384
everyone here is feeling
reasonably good about it.

2395
02:04:19,819 --> 02:04:21,454
It's been a long road.

2396
02:04:21,488 --> 02:04:24,290
I think one of
the wisest things I ever did

2397
02:04:24,324 --> 02:04:27,360
was when I selected
the director of Los Alamos.

2398
02:04:29,729 --> 02:04:32,065
<i>We have spent</i>

2399
02:04:32,098 --> 02:04:34,100
<i>more than $2 billion</i>

2400
02:04:34,133 --> 02:04:38,371
<i>on the greatest</i>
<i>scientific gamble in history,</i>

2401
02:04:38,404 --> 02:04:41,241
<i>and we have won.</i>

2402
02:04:44,777 --> 02:04:47,480
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2403
02:04:47,514 --> 02:04:49,516
Oppie! Oppie!

2404
02:04:49,549 --> 02:04:52,752
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2405
02:04:52,785 --> 02:04:54,621
Oppie! Oppie!

2406
02:04:54,654 --> 02:04:57,423
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2407
02:04:57,457 --> 02:05:00,793
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2408
02:05:00,827 --> 02:05:05,431
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2409
02:05:05,465 --> 02:05:06,799
Oppie! Oppie!

2410
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:09,402
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2411
02:06:08,494 --> 02:06:09,596
The world...

2412
02:06:11,598 --> 02:06:12,732
...will remember this day.

2413
02:06:31,651 --> 02:06:33,386
It's too soon to...

2414
02:06:34,253 --> 02:06:35,922
It's too soon to determine

2415
02:06:35,955 --> 02:06:38,324
what the results
of the bombing are.

2416
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:42,862
But I'll bet the Japanese
didn't like it.

2417
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:05,284
I'm so proud.

2418
02:07:06,419 --> 02:07:08,554
So proud of what
you have accomplished.

2419
02:07:14,861 --> 02:07:18,698
I just wish we had it in time
to use against the Germans.

2420
02:09:08,541 --> 02:09:10,409
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2421
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:13,312
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2422
02:09:13,346 --> 02:09:15,014
-Nice picture.
-Oh.

2423
02:09:15,048 --> 02:09:17,383
President Truman
will see you now.

2424
02:09:31,098 --> 02:09:33,933
Dr. Oppenheimer. It's an honor.

2425
02:09:33,966 --> 02:09:35,902
-Mr. President.
-Please.

2426
02:09:35,935 --> 02:09:37,737
Thank you.

2427
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:39,305
Secretary Byrnes.

2428
02:09:40,506 --> 02:09:42,508
How's it feel to be

2429
02:09:42,542 --> 02:09:44,577
the most famous man
in the world?

2430
02:09:45,578 --> 02:09:48,648
You helped save a lot
of American lives.

2431
02:09:48,681 --> 02:09:51,051
What we did
at Hiroshima was a...

2432
02:09:51,084 --> 02:09:53,019
And Nagasaki.

2433
02:09:53,053 --> 02:09:55,055
Well, obviously.

2434
02:09:55,088 --> 02:09:59,025
Your invention let us
bring our boys home.

2435
02:09:59,059 --> 02:10:02,428
Well, it was hardly
my invention.

2436
02:10:02,461 --> 02:10:04,730
It was you on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

2437
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:09,136
Jim tells me you're concerned

2438
02:10:09,169 --> 02:10:10,937
about an arms race
with the Soviets.

2439
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:13,339
Uh, yes, uh...

2440
02:10:14,041 --> 02:10:15,541
Well, um,

2441
02:10:15,575 --> 02:10:20,680
it's that, uh, now is
our chance to secure

2442
02:10:20,713 --> 02:10:23,583
international cooperation on
atomic energy,

2443
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:26,652
and... and I'm concerned...

2444
02:10:26,686 --> 02:10:28,921
Do you know when the Soviets
are gonna have the bomb?

2445
02:10:28,955 --> 02:10:30,890
I don't think I could give a...

2446
02:10:30,923 --> 02:10:32,326
Never.

2447
02:10:32,959 --> 02:10:34,594
Never.

2448
02:10:34,627 --> 02:10:37,797
Mr. President, the-the Russians
have good physicists

2449
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:39,465
and-and...
and abundant resources.

2450
02:10:39,498 --> 02:10:41,601
-Abundant?
-Yes.

2451
02:10:41,634 --> 02:10:44,904
I don't think so.

2452
02:10:44,937 --> 02:10:48,474
Well, they'll-they'll put
everything they have and...

2453
02:10:51,744 --> 02:10:55,615
I hear you're leaving
Los Alamos.

2454
02:10:56,883 --> 02:10:57,984
What should we do with it?

2455
02:10:58,017 --> 02:11:00,519
Give it back to the Indians.

2456
02:11:07,927 --> 02:11:11,164
Um... Dr. Oppenheimer,

2457
02:11:11,198 --> 02:11:13,532
if what you say about
the Soviets is true,

2458
02:11:13,566 --> 02:11:16,969
we have to build up Los Alamos,

2459
02:11:17,003 --> 02:11:18,905
not shut it down.

2460
02:11:22,142 --> 02:11:23,943
Uh, Mr. President...

2461
02:11:25,011 --> 02:11:26,512
Um...

2462
02:11:29,182 --> 02:11:32,852
I feel that I have blood
on my hands.

2463
02:11:52,638 --> 02:11:57,944
You think anyone
in Hiroshima or Nagasaki

2464
02:11:57,977 --> 02:12:01,013
gives a shit who built the bomb?

2465
02:12:04,184 --> 02:12:06,552
They care who dropped it.

2466
02:12:07,254 --> 02:12:09,522
I did.

2467
02:12:10,756 --> 02:12:13,726
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2468
02:12:19,865 --> 02:12:22,001
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2469
02:12:32,945 --> 02:12:35,748
Don't let that crybaby
back in here.

2470
02:12:40,853 --> 02:12:43,889
<i>Robert saw that</i>
<i>hand-wringing got him nowhere.</i>

2471
02:12:43,923 --> 02:12:47,260
<i>By the time I'd met him,</i>
<i>he'd fully embraced</i>

2472
02:12:47,294 --> 02:12:49,862
<i>his "father of the bomb"</i>
<i>reputation.</i>

2473
02:12:49,895 --> 02:12:52,299
Used his profile
to influence policy.

2474
02:13:01,774 --> 02:13:03,143
<i>Doctor, in the years</i>
<i>following the war,</i>

2475
02:13:03,176 --> 02:13:05,312
would you say that
you exerted a great influence

2476
02:13:05,345 --> 02:13:07,147
on the atomic policies
of the USA?

2477
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:09,882
<i>I think great</i>
<i>would be an overstatement.</i>

2478
02:13:09,915 --> 02:13:11,884
Really? If we look
at the issue of isotopes,

2479
02:13:11,917 --> 02:13:13,619
were you not
personally responsible

2480
02:13:13,652 --> 02:13:15,688
for destroying all opposition
to their export?

2481
02:13:15,721 --> 02:13:18,591
Could use a-a bottle of beer...

2482
02:13:18,624 --> 02:13:20,293
...when making atomic weapons.
In fact, you do.

2483
02:13:20,327 --> 02:13:22,795
I was the spokesman,
but the-the opinion

2484
02:13:22,828 --> 02:13:24,630
among scientists was unanimous.

2485
02:13:24,663 --> 02:13:26,333
All along with McCarthy
on the rise,

2486
02:13:26,366 --> 02:13:27,767
he knew he was vulnerable.

2487
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:29,169
His brother was blacklisted

2488
02:13:29,202 --> 02:13:32,105
by every university
in the country.

2489
02:13:33,206 --> 02:13:36,043
Lomanitz wound up working
the railroad, laying track.

2490
02:13:38,644 --> 02:13:40,080
And Chevalier went into exile.

2491
02:13:43,216 --> 02:13:44,650
But none of that

2492
02:13:44,683 --> 02:13:46,652
stopped Robert
from pushing the GAC

2493
02:13:46,685 --> 02:13:49,555
to recommend arms control
instead of the H-bomb.

2494
02:13:51,358 --> 02:13:52,825
He was devastated

2495
02:13:52,858 --> 02:13:54,927
when Truman rejected
their recommendation.

2496
02:13:56,662 --> 02:13:59,199
I miss Richard
more than I can bear.

2497
02:13:59,232 --> 02:14:01,000
I know, Ruth, I know.

2498
02:14:01,034 --> 02:14:04,137
Part of me's glad he didn't live
to see where this is all going.

2499
02:14:06,906 --> 02:14:08,341
Here comes the birthday boy.

2500
02:14:08,375 --> 02:14:10,976
-To gloat.
-Have fun.

2501
02:14:11,977 --> 02:14:14,347
Robert, uh, my son and his
fiancée are desperate to meet

2502
02:14:14,381 --> 02:14:16,349
the father of the atomic bomb,
and so...

2503
02:14:16,383 --> 02:14:19,186
Well. Good day.

2504
02:14:25,258 --> 02:14:27,360
Is this a bad time?

2505
02:14:27,394 --> 02:14:28,894
What do you think, Lewis?

2506
02:14:28,928 --> 02:14:30,996
Well, I think it must have
been a blow for you.

2507
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:33,166
For the world.

2508
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:34,834
The world?

2509
02:14:34,867 --> 02:14:38,838
What does Fuchs mean
to the rest of the world?

2510
02:14:38,871 --> 02:14:40,273
Fuchs?

2511
02:14:40,307 --> 02:14:41,907
Klaus Fuchs?

2512
02:14:43,343 --> 02:14:45,744
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2513
02:14:48,914 --> 02:14:50,783
Klaus Fuchs, the British
scientist that you put

2514
02:14:50,816 --> 02:14:53,853
onto the implosion team
at Los Alamos,

2515
02:14:53,886 --> 02:14:56,021
<i>turns out he was...</i>

2516
02:14:56,056 --> 02:14:59,326
he was spying for the Soviets
the whole time.

2517
02:14:59,359 --> 02:15:00,893
I'm sorry.

2518
02:15:06,066 --> 02:15:08,968
<i>After the truth</i>
<i>about Fuchs came out,</i>

2519
02:15:09,001 --> 02:15:11,104
the FBI stepped up
surveillance on him.

2520
02:15:11,138 --> 02:15:15,007
He knew his phone was tapped,
he was followed everywhere...

2521
02:15:16,376 --> 02:15:17,810
...his trash picked through.

2522
02:15:21,814 --> 02:15:23,283
But never stopped
speaking his mind.

2523
02:15:23,316 --> 02:15:25,985
A man of conviction.

2524
02:15:26,018 --> 02:15:28,854
And maybe he thought fame
could actually protect him.

2525
02:15:30,357 --> 02:15:33,792
When Eisenhower took office,
he saw one more chance.

2526
02:15:35,195 --> 02:15:36,229
He took it.

2527
02:15:36,263 --> 02:15:38,731
America and Russia

2528
02:15:38,764 --> 02:15:43,036
may be likened
to two scorpions in a bottle,

2529
02:15:43,069 --> 02:15:46,439
each capable
of killing the other

2530
02:15:46,473 --> 02:15:49,176
but only at the risk
of his own life.

2531
02:15:49,209 --> 02:15:51,977
Now, there are various aspects
of this policy...

2532
02:15:52,011 --> 02:15:54,013
<i>Lot of scientists blame me,</i>

2533
02:15:54,047 --> 02:15:57,184
<i>but how was I supposed</i>
<i>to protect him?</i>

2534
02:15:57,217 --> 02:15:59,186
...too secret for discussion,

2535
02:15:59,219 --> 02:16:01,221
candor is the only remedy.

2536
02:16:01,254 --> 02:16:02,788
Officials in Washington

2537
02:16:02,821 --> 02:16:04,324
need to start leveling
with the American people.

2538
02:16:06,025 --> 02:16:08,861
That was the last straw
for Robert's enemies.

2539
02:16:08,894 --> 02:16:10,930
So he had to lose
his security clearance.

2540
02:16:10,963 --> 02:16:13,732
And with it, his credibility.

2541
02:16:13,766 --> 02:16:16,169
But how could they do it?

2542
02:16:16,203 --> 02:16:17,470
He was a war hero.

2543
02:16:17,504 --> 02:16:19,206
He'd already told everyone
about his past.

2544
02:16:19,239 --> 02:16:21,208
Borden dredged it all up.

2545
02:16:21,241 --> 02:16:24,477
How could Borden get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2546
02:16:24,511 --> 02:16:26,079
Could it have been Nichols?

2547
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:28,415
No, I can't imagine
he'd do that.

2548
02:16:28,448 --> 02:16:30,483
But whoever did
unleashed a firestorm

2549
02:16:30,517 --> 02:16:32,519
that burned a path
from the White House

2550
02:16:32,552 --> 02:16:35,222
back to my desk at the AEC.

2551
02:16:35,255 --> 02:16:37,090
You see them in there, right?

2552
02:16:37,123 --> 02:16:40,993
I've been working
my whole life to get here.

2553
02:16:41,026 --> 02:16:43,063
Cabinet of
the United States of America.

2554
02:16:43,096 --> 02:16:45,030
Now, in front
of the entire country,

2555
02:16:45,065 --> 02:16:47,133
they're gonna put me
back in my place.

2556
02:16:48,568 --> 02:16:51,238
A lowly shoe salesman.

2557
02:16:51,271 --> 02:16:53,106
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2558
02:16:53,139 --> 02:16:55,208
I-I think we can
get the Senate to grasp

2559
02:16:55,242 --> 02:16:58,044
that you did your duty,
painful though it was.

2560
02:16:58,078 --> 02:16:59,845
Now, will Hill's testimony
back us up?

2561
02:16:59,878 --> 02:17:01,847
-Hill will be fine.
-I don't really know him,

2562
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,050
but, uh, he was one
of Szilard's boys in Chicago,

2563
02:17:04,084 --> 02:17:06,119
and they never forgave Robert
for not supporting

2564
02:17:06,152 --> 02:17:08,555
their petition
against bombing Japan.

2565
02:17:08,588 --> 02:17:13,792
This was taken 31 days
after the bombing.

2566
02:17:13,826 --> 02:17:16,563
Virtually everyone
in the street,

2567
02:17:16,596 --> 02:17:18,831
for nearly a mile around,

2568
02:17:18,864 --> 02:17:22,068
was instantly
and seriously burned.

2569
02:17:23,303 --> 02:17:27,840
The, uh, Japanese spoke of
people who wore striped clothing

2570
02:17:27,873 --> 02:17:30,843
upon whom the skin
was burned in stripes.

2571
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:34,281
There were many
who thought themselves lucky,

2572
02:17:34,314 --> 02:17:37,016
who climbed out of the ruins
of their homes

2573
02:17:37,050 --> 02:17:38,917
only slightly injured.

2574
02:17:40,053 --> 02:17:41,820
But they died anyway.

2575
02:17:42,489 --> 02:17:45,592
They died days or weeks later

2576
02:17:45,625 --> 02:17:48,961
from the radium-like rays
emitted in great numbers

2577
02:17:48,994 --> 02:17:50,896
at the moment of the explosion.

2578
02:17:52,098 --> 02:17:54,167
Did you read this crap
in the papers?

2579
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:57,002
A British physicist is saying
the atomic bombings

2580
02:17:57,037 --> 02:17:59,205
were not the last act
of World War II

2581
02:17:59,239 --> 02:18:02,375
but the first act
of this cold war with Russia.

2582
02:18:02,409 --> 02:18:03,876
Which physicist?

2583
02:18:03,909 --> 02:18:05,312
I think you knew him.

2584
02:18:05,345 --> 02:18:06,945
Patrick Blackett.

2585
02:18:09,416 --> 02:18:10,983
He may not be wrong.

2586
02:18:11,016 --> 02:18:12,352
Stimson is now telling me

2587
02:18:12,385 --> 02:18:15,622
we bombed an enemy
that was essentially defeated.

2588
02:18:15,655 --> 02:18:19,192
Robert,
you've all the influence now.

2589
02:18:19,225 --> 02:18:20,926
Please.

2590
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:23,063
Urge them to continue
my research on the Super.

2591
02:18:23,096 --> 02:18:24,464
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2592
02:18:24,497 --> 02:18:26,599
Why not?

2593
02:18:26,633 --> 02:18:28,335
It's not the right use
of our resources.

2594
02:18:28,368 --> 02:18:30,470
Is that what you really believe?

2595
02:18:30,503 --> 02:18:32,871
J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2596
02:18:32,905 --> 02:18:35,308
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

2597
02:18:36,609 --> 02:18:38,378
Nobody knows what you believe.

2598
02:18:39,479 --> 02:18:41,348
Do you? Hmm?

2599
02:18:41,381 --> 02:18:44,084
<i>One final time,</i>
<i>our program director,</i>

2600
02:18:44,117 --> 02:18:46,086
<i>Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.</i>

2601
02:18:47,287 --> 02:18:49,055
<i>I hope that in years to come</i>

2602
02:18:49,089 --> 02:18:53,093
you will look back
on your work here with pride.

2603
02:18:53,126 --> 02:18:55,495
But today, that pride
must be tempered

2604
02:18:55,528 --> 02:18:57,863
with a profound concern.

2605
02:18:59,132 --> 02:19:00,933
If atomic weapons
are to be added

2606
02:19:00,966 --> 02:19:03,370
to the arsenals
of a warring world,

2607
02:19:03,403 --> 02:19:06,972
then the day will come
when people will curse

2608
02:19:07,005 --> 02:19:08,408
the name of Los Alamos.

2609
02:19:12,412 --> 02:19:14,514
Uh, sorry, Admiral.

2610
02:19:14,547 --> 02:19:16,549
Stopped off to get this.

2611
02:19:16,583 --> 02:19:19,386
It seems pretty favorable.

2612
02:19:19,419 --> 02:19:20,520
There's Oppenheimer.

2613
02:19:20,553 --> 02:19:22,122
What's the caption?

2614
02:19:22,155 --> 02:19:24,990
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Strauss fought..."

2615
02:19:26,559 --> 02:19:28,128
"...and the US won."

2616
02:19:28,961 --> 02:19:30,230
That'll work.

2617
02:19:30,263 --> 02:19:32,499
Those were your words
from the other day.

2618
02:19:32,532 --> 02:19:33,932
We needed to pivot.

2619
02:19:33,966 --> 02:19:35,235
But how would you know

2620
02:19:35,268 --> 02:19:37,070
what <i>Time</i> magazine's
gonna write?

2621
02:19:37,103 --> 02:19:39,339
Henry Luce is a friend.

2622
02:19:45,478 --> 02:19:48,981
You sat here and let me
tell you how it's done,

2623
02:19:49,014 --> 02:19:51,684
but you've been
far ahead all along.

2624
02:19:51,718 --> 02:19:54,687
Survival in Washington

2625
02:19:54,721 --> 02:19:57,056
is about knowing
how to get things done.

2626
02:19:57,690 --> 02:19:59,092
Right.

2627
02:20:00,693 --> 02:20:02,429
What was it you said
about Borden?

2628
02:20:02,462 --> 02:20:05,465
"Why get caught
holding the knife yourself?"

2629
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:10,303
I'm beginning to think Borden
was holding the knife for you.

2630
02:20:12,372 --> 02:20:14,607
It's gonna come down
to how much influence

2631
02:20:14,641 --> 02:20:16,709
Borden's been able
to exert on Teller.

2632
02:20:16,743 --> 02:20:19,179
Did I say something funny?

2633
02:20:19,212 --> 02:20:20,580
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"

2634
02:20:20,613 --> 02:20:24,384
when we all know
that it's Strauss.

2635
02:20:24,417 --> 02:20:26,386
Lewis brought me
to Princeton, Kitty.

2636
02:20:26,419 --> 02:20:29,122
And then you humiliated him
in front of Congress.

2637
02:20:29,155 --> 02:20:31,990
But more useful than a sandwich.

2638
02:20:35,161 --> 02:20:36,329
-How'd I do?
-I'll call recess,

2639
02:20:36,362 --> 02:20:37,464
ten minutes.

2640
02:20:37,497 --> 02:20:39,732
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2641
02:20:39,766 --> 02:20:40,999
That was six years ago.

2642
02:20:41,034 --> 02:20:42,735
You know, the truly vindictive,

2643
02:20:42,769 --> 02:20:44,370
patient as saints.

2644
02:20:44,404 --> 02:20:47,207
Strauss has been perfectly
clear that he is neutral.

2645
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:50,743
Wake up. It is Strauss.

2646
02:20:50,777 --> 02:20:53,713
It's always been Strauss,
and you know it.

2647
02:20:53,746 --> 02:20:55,381
Why won't you fight him?

2648
02:20:56,416 --> 02:20:57,617
Christ's sake.

2649
02:20:58,718 --> 02:21:01,387
It wasn't Nichols or Hoover

2650
02:21:01,421 --> 02:21:03,089
or one of Truman's guys.
It was you.

2651
02:21:03,122 --> 02:21:05,091
You gave the file to Borden.

2652
02:21:05,124 --> 02:21:06,759
You set him on Oppenheimer.

2653
02:21:06,793 --> 02:21:09,229
-You convinced him to...
-Borden...

2654
02:21:09,262 --> 02:21:11,164
didn't take any convincing.

2655
02:21:11,197 --> 02:21:13,299
Take your time,
use the entire file.

2656
02:21:13,333 --> 02:21:16,236
Write up your conclusion,
send them to the FBI.

2657
02:21:16,269 --> 02:21:18,505
The material
is obviously extensive,

2658
02:21:18,538 --> 02:21:21,207
but there's nothing new here.

2659
02:21:21,241 --> 02:21:22,775
Your conclusions will be.

2660
02:21:22,809 --> 02:21:25,111
And they'll have to be answered.

2661
02:21:25,144 --> 02:21:26,613
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2662
02:21:26,646 --> 02:21:30,250
Oppenheimer's too slippery
for that self-promoting clown.

2663
02:21:30,283 --> 02:21:33,152
I've talked it over with Hoover,
he'll hold McCarthy at bay

2664
02:21:33,186 --> 02:21:34,787
while you do this with the AEC.

2665
02:21:34,821 --> 02:21:36,656
-A trial.
-No.

2666
02:21:36,689 --> 02:21:40,460
No trial. You can't
give Oppenheimer a platform.

2667
02:21:40,493 --> 02:21:42,262
You can't martyr him.

2668
02:21:42,295 --> 02:21:45,465
We need a systematic destruction
of Oppenheimer's credibility

2669
02:21:45,498 --> 02:21:49,068
so he can never again speak
on matters of national security.

2670
02:21:49,102 --> 02:21:51,170
Then what?

2671
02:21:52,372 --> 02:21:55,742
A shabby little room,
far from the limelight.

2672
02:22:02,181 --> 02:22:03,449
<i>A simple bureaucratic procedure.</i>

2673
02:22:03,483 --> 02:22:06,119
His Q clearance
is up for renewal.

2674
02:22:06,152 --> 02:22:09,122
You send your accusations
to the FBI.

2675
02:22:10,757 --> 02:22:14,360
Hoover sends them to the AEC,
you're forced to act.

2676
02:22:15,194 --> 02:22:16,496
You write up an indictment

2677
02:22:16,529 --> 02:22:18,164
<i>and tell Oppenheimer</i>

2678
02:22:18,197 --> 02:22:20,867
<i>his security clearance</i>
<i>is not being renewed.</i>

2679
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:22,435
<i>But offer him</i>
<i>the chance to appeal.</i>

2680
02:22:22,468 --> 02:22:24,804
As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

2681
02:22:24,837 --> 02:22:26,339
May I keep this?

2682
02:22:26,372 --> 02:22:27,307
No.

2683
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:29,576
If you do decide to appeal,

2684
02:22:29,609 --> 02:22:31,144
they'll have to send you a copy.

2685
02:22:31,177 --> 02:22:34,414
When he appeals--
and trust me, he will--

2686
02:22:34,447 --> 02:22:36,849
I appoint a board.

2687
02:22:36,883 --> 02:22:39,352
They will, of course,
have counsel.

2688
02:22:39,385 --> 02:22:41,321
-Prosecutor?
-In all but name.

2689
02:22:41,354 --> 02:22:43,523
-Who?
-Roger Robb.

2690
02:22:43,556 --> 02:22:44,724
Ouch.

2691
02:22:44,757 --> 02:22:46,225
Robb will have
security clearance

2692
02:22:46,259 --> 02:22:47,794
<i>to examine Oppenheimer's file.</i>

2693
02:22:47,827 --> 02:22:49,262
<i>As will the Gray board.</i>

2694
02:22:49,295 --> 02:22:50,663
Defense counsel will not.

2695
02:22:52,498 --> 02:22:53,900
A closed hearing.

2696
02:22:53,933 --> 02:22:55,168
<i>The so-called</i>
<i>derogatory information</i>

2697
02:22:55,201 --> 02:22:57,370
in your indictment of me.

2698
02:22:57,403 --> 02:22:59,872
No audience. No reporters.

2699
02:22:59,906 --> 02:23:03,376
-No burden of proof.
-No burden of proof?

2700
02:23:04,744 --> 02:23:06,245
We're not convicting.

2701
02:23:06,946 --> 02:23:09,549
We're just denying.

2702
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:17,290
What is it you said?

2703
02:23:17,323 --> 02:23:20,660
"This is just how
the game is played."

2704
02:23:20,693 --> 02:23:23,663
Well, forgive my naivete.

2705
02:23:23,696 --> 02:23:25,665
Amateurs seek the sun.

2706
02:23:26,633 --> 02:23:27,700
Get eaten.

2707
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:31,604
Power stays in the shadows.

2708
02:23:31,638 --> 02:23:35,341
But, sir, you're...
you're out of the shadows now.

2709
02:23:35,375 --> 02:23:36,809
Yeah, that's why
this has to work.

2710
02:23:36,843 --> 02:23:38,311
Well...

2711
02:23:39,612 --> 02:23:41,748
Teller's testifying
this morning.

2712
02:23:41,781 --> 02:23:44,183
That'll help. And then...

2713
02:23:44,217 --> 02:23:45,652
Hill is in the afternoon.

2714
02:23:45,685 --> 02:23:48,154
Hill is gonna help us too.

2715
02:23:50,390 --> 02:23:53,559
As you can see,
Robert, it's not yet signed.

2716
02:23:53,593 --> 02:23:54,627
May I keep this?

2717
02:23:54,661 --> 02:23:55,695
No.

2718
02:23:57,797 --> 02:23:59,799
If you do decide to appeal,

2719
02:23:59,832 --> 02:24:02,669
then they'll have
to send you a copy.

2720
02:24:06,239 --> 02:24:08,541
Take my car and driver.
I insist.

2721
02:24:13,279 --> 02:24:15,214
I'll have to consult
my lawyers, Lewis.

2722
02:24:15,248 --> 02:24:17,950
Of course.
But don't take too long.

2723
02:24:17,984 --> 02:24:20,186
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2724
02:24:26,325 --> 02:24:28,628
I'm sorry
it's come to this, Robert.

2725
02:24:28,661 --> 02:24:29,696
I think it's wrong.

2726
02:24:43,009 --> 02:24:44,444
<i>Nichols wants me to fight</i>

2727
02:24:44,477 --> 02:24:46,479
<i>so he can get it</i>
<i>all on the record.</i>

2728
02:24:46,512 --> 02:24:48,381
Strauss wants me to walk away.

2729
02:24:48,414 --> 02:24:51,250
Strauss knows
that you can't do that,

2730
02:24:51,284 --> 02:24:53,720
you'd be accepting the charges.

2731
02:24:53,753 --> 02:24:55,421
You'll lose your job.

2732
02:24:55,455 --> 02:24:57,724
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.

2733
02:24:57,757 --> 02:25:00,460
Robert, we have to fight.

2734
02:25:03,029 --> 02:25:05,331
As AEC Counsel,
I can't represent you.

2735
02:25:05,364 --> 02:25:06,899
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2736
02:25:06,933 --> 02:25:08,468
Oh, he's good.

2737
02:25:08,501 --> 02:25:12,238
The best,
but I have to warn you...

2738
02:25:12,905 --> 02:25:15,341
...this won't be a fair fight.

2739
02:25:15,374 --> 02:25:17,376
<i>During your interview</i>

2740
02:25:17,410 --> 02:25:19,879
with Boris Pash in 1943,
did you refer to microfilm?

2741
02:25:19,912 --> 02:25:21,414
-No.
-Tab 11,

2742
02:25:21,447 --> 02:25:22,882
page one, paragraph three.
You never said,

2743
02:25:22,915 --> 02:25:26,552
"Man at the consulate expert
in the use of microfilm"?

2744
02:25:26,586 --> 02:25:27,920
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-No.

2745
02:25:27,954 --> 02:25:28,888
I would like to know
what document

2746
02:25:28,921 --> 02:25:30,356
Mr. Robb is quoting from

2747
02:25:30,389 --> 02:25:31,657
and if we might be
furnished with a copy.

2748
02:25:31,691 --> 02:25:33,760
The document is classified,
Mr. Garrison.

2749
02:25:33,793 --> 02:25:35,628
I think we should get back
to first-hand information.

2750
02:25:35,661 --> 02:25:37,029
This is first-hand.

2751
02:25:37,064 --> 02:25:39,332
How so, Roger?

2752
02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:42,535
There was a recording
of the interview.

2753
02:25:46,506 --> 02:25:48,407
You let my client sit here

2754
02:25:48,441 --> 02:25:49,942
and potentially perjure himself,

2755
02:25:49,976 --> 02:25:52,512
and all this time,
you had a recording?

2756
02:25:52,545 --> 02:25:53,913
Nobody told your client

2757
02:25:53,946 --> 02:25:55,348
to misrepresent
his former answers.

2758
02:25:55,381 --> 02:25:57,450
Misrepre...
It-it was 12 years ago.

2759
02:25:57,483 --> 02:25:58,785
Can we hear this recording?

2760
02:25:58,818 --> 02:26:00,386
You don't have the clearance,
Mr. Garrison.

2761
02:26:00,419 --> 02:26:02,055
But you're reading it
into the record.

2762
02:26:02,089 --> 02:26:03,723
Please, please.

2763
02:26:03,756 --> 02:26:07,360
Is this proceeding interested
in entrapment or in truth?

2764
02:26:07,393 --> 02:26:09,829
If it's truth,
where's the disclosure?

2765
02:26:09,862 --> 02:26:11,497
Where's the witness list?

2766
02:26:11,531 --> 02:26:14,067
Mr. Garrison, this isn't
a trial, as you are well aware.

2767
02:26:14,101 --> 02:26:15,968
Evidentiary rules do not apply.

2768
02:26:16,002 --> 02:26:17,870
We are dealing
with national security.

2769
02:26:17,904 --> 02:26:19,405
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

2770
02:26:19,438 --> 02:26:21,808
I fail to see how
national security

2771
02:26:21,841 --> 02:26:23,543
prevents the prosecution
from providing us

2772
02:26:23,576 --> 02:26:25,578
-with a list of witnesses.
-Perhaps we are in need

2773
02:26:25,611 --> 02:26:26,913
-of a brief recess.
-Gentlemen,

2774
02:26:26,946 --> 02:26:28,681
you have my words.

2775
02:26:28,714 --> 02:26:30,850
If you say they're from a
transcript, then I'll accept it.

2776
02:26:30,883 --> 02:26:33,653
I've already explained
I made up a cock-and-bull story.

2777
02:26:33,686 --> 02:26:37,023
But why would anyone
make up such an elaborate story?

2778
02:26:37,057 --> 02:26:39,126
Because I was an idiot.

2779
02:26:39,159 --> 02:26:40,760
Why lie?

2780
02:26:40,793 --> 02:26:43,396
Well, clearly with
the intention of not revealing

2781
02:26:43,429 --> 02:26:45,498
who the intermediary was.

2782
02:26:45,531 --> 02:26:47,567
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier,
the Communist.

2783
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,869
Is he still your friend?

2784
02:26:49,902 --> 02:26:51,337
Yes.

2785
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:56,375
Dr. Rabi, thank you for coming.

2786
02:26:56,409 --> 02:26:58,111
Do you know who else
the prosecution has called?

2787
02:26:58,145 --> 02:27:00,479
Teller, obviously.

2788
02:27:01,447 --> 02:27:02,715
They've asked Lawrence.

2789
02:27:02,748 --> 02:27:03,583
What did he say?

2790
02:27:03,616 --> 02:27:06,519
He wasn't going
to help them, but...

2791
02:27:06,552 --> 02:27:07,486
But?

2792
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:09,522
Strauss told him that
you and Ruth Tolman

2793
02:27:09,555 --> 02:27:11,991
<i>have been having</i>
<i>an affair for years.</i>

2794
02:27:12,024 --> 02:27:13,126
<i>The whole time you lived</i>

2795
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:14,794
with them in Pasadena.

2796
02:27:14,827 --> 02:27:16,495
He convinced Lawrence

2797
02:27:16,529 --> 02:27:18,098
that Richard died
of a broken heart.

2798
02:27:18,131 --> 02:27:19,432
That's absurd.

2799
02:27:19,465 --> 02:27:22,001
-What part?
-The broken heart.

2800
02:27:22,035 --> 02:27:24,071
Richard never found out.

2801
02:27:24,104 --> 02:27:25,872
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

2802
02:27:25,905 --> 02:27:27,406
I don't know.

2803
02:27:27,940 --> 02:27:29,575
Dr. Rabi,

2804
02:27:29,609 --> 02:27:32,678
what governmental positions
do you currently hold?

2805
02:27:32,712 --> 02:27:35,615
I am the chairman of the
General Advisory Committee

2806
02:27:35,648 --> 02:27:38,551
to the AEC,
succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

2807
02:27:38,584 --> 02:27:41,420
And how long have
you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

2808
02:27:41,454 --> 02:27:43,056
Since 1928.

2809
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:45,158
I... I know him quite well.

2810
02:27:45,192 --> 02:27:47,160
Well enough
to speak to the bearing

2811
02:27:47,194 --> 02:27:49,762
of his loyalty and character?

2812
02:27:49,795 --> 02:27:53,799
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man
of upstanding character.

2813
02:27:53,833 --> 02:27:56,502
And he is loyal
to the United States,

2814
02:27:56,535 --> 02:27:57,770
to his friends,

2815
02:27:57,803 --> 02:28:00,473
to the institutions
of which he is part.

2816
02:28:01,941 --> 02:28:02,975
Eat.

2817
02:28:21,961 --> 02:28:23,663
What was that?

2818
02:28:23,696 --> 02:28:25,731
Nothing to worry about.

2819
02:28:27,967 --> 02:28:29,702
<i>After the Russian A-bomb test,</i>

2820
02:28:29,735 --> 02:28:32,205
did Dr. Lawrence come to see you
about the hydrogen bomb?

2821
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:34,041
You'd be better off asking him.

2822
02:28:34,074 --> 02:28:35,608
Well, I fully intend to.

2823
02:28:35,641 --> 02:28:38,211
Would you say
that Dr. Oppenheimer was

2824
02:28:38,245 --> 02:28:40,247
unalterably opposed
to the H-bomb?

2825
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:43,083
No, he-he thought that
a fusion program

2826
02:28:43,116 --> 02:28:46,219
would come at the expense of our
awfully good fission program.

2827
02:28:46,253 --> 02:28:48,088
But that proved
not to be the case.

2828
02:28:48,121 --> 02:28:50,756
In the event both could be done.

2829
02:28:50,790 --> 02:28:53,093
Suppose that this board
did not feel satisfied

2830
02:28:53,126 --> 02:28:54,261
that in his testimony here,

2831
02:28:54,294 --> 02:28:56,562
Dr. Oppenheimer had been
wholly truthful.

2832
02:28:56,595 --> 02:28:59,799
What would you say whether
or not he should be cleared?

2833
02:28:59,832 --> 02:29:01,734
Why go through
all this against a man

2834
02:29:01,767 --> 02:29:03,970
who has accomplished
what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

2835
02:29:04,003 --> 02:29:05,638
Look at his record.

2836
02:29:05,671 --> 02:29:07,740
We have an A-bomb
and a whole series of it.

2837
02:29:07,773 --> 02:29:09,709
We have a whole series
of Super bombs.

2838
02:29:09,742 --> 02:29:11,711
What more do you want?

2839
02:29:11,744 --> 02:29:12,611
Mermaids?

2840
02:29:12,645 --> 02:29:14,947
But I've known Secretary Strauss

2841
02:29:14,981 --> 02:29:16,582
for many years,

2842
02:29:16,615 --> 02:29:19,885
and I feel it a necessity
to express the warm support

2843
02:29:19,919 --> 02:29:22,588
for science and scientists
Lewis has shown.

2844
02:29:22,621 --> 02:29:23,856
We'll break now,

2845
02:29:23,889 --> 02:29:25,691
unless there's
any immediate business.

2846
02:29:25,725 --> 02:29:28,261
Senator, I'd like
to once again request

2847
02:29:28,295 --> 02:29:30,963
that we're furnished
with a list of witnesses.

2848
02:29:30,997 --> 02:29:33,766
And I will remind the nominee
that we don't always

2849
02:29:33,799 --> 02:29:35,801
have that information
in advance.

2850
02:29:35,835 --> 02:29:39,272
We do know that Dr. Hill
will be here after lunch.

2851
02:29:39,306 --> 02:29:40,940
Mr. Chairman,
our next scheduled witness,

2852
02:29:40,973 --> 02:29:45,511
Dr. Lawrence, has apparently
come down with colitis.

2853
02:29:46,979 --> 02:29:49,882
So we'll proceed with
William Borden instead.

2854
02:29:51,151 --> 02:29:52,551
Mr. Borden, welcome.

2855
02:29:52,585 --> 02:29:54,054
Please take a seat.

2856
02:29:55,222 --> 02:29:57,623
Mr. Borden,

2857
02:29:57,656 --> 02:30:00,227
during your investigation
into Dr. Oppenheimer,

2858
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:01,894
did you reach
certain conclusions?

2859
02:30:01,927 --> 02:30:04,231
-I did.
-And did there come a time

2860
02:30:04,264 --> 02:30:05,731
when you expressed
those conclusions

2861
02:30:05,765 --> 02:30:07,767
in a letter
to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover

2862
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:09,735
of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation?

2863
02:30:09,769 --> 02:30:11,171
-That is correct.
-Prior to the writing

2864
02:30:11,204 --> 02:30:12,972
of the letter, did you discuss
the writing of the letter

2865
02:30:13,005 --> 02:30:15,308
with anybody attached to
the Atomic Energy Commission?

2866
02:30:15,342 --> 02:30:16,942
I did not.

2867
02:30:16,976 --> 02:30:18,311
Thanks, and do you have
a copy of the letter?

2868
02:30:18,345 --> 02:30:19,945
I have one in front of me.

2869
02:30:19,979 --> 02:30:22,082
Would you please be so kind
as to read it, sir?

2870
02:30:22,115 --> 02:30:23,649
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

2871
02:30:23,682 --> 02:30:25,118
the purpose of this letter
is to state..."

2872
02:30:25,152 --> 02:30:27,187
Uh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, if I could have a...

2873
02:30:27,220 --> 02:30:29,588
What is the purpose
of the delay?

2874
02:30:29,622 --> 02:30:31,091
He's simply gonna
read the letter.

2875
02:30:31,124 --> 02:30:32,658
Mr. Chairman,

2876
02:30:32,691 --> 02:30:34,693
this is the first
I've seen of this letter,

2877
02:30:34,727 --> 02:30:35,995
and I see statements here, uh,

2878
02:30:36,028 --> 02:30:37,997
at least one,
of a kind that I don't think

2879
02:30:38,030 --> 02:30:39,999
anyone would like to see
go into the record.

2880
02:30:40,032 --> 02:30:42,802
These are accusations that have
not previously been made.

2881
02:30:42,835 --> 02:30:44,770
That are not part of
the indictment from Nichols.

2882
02:30:44,804 --> 02:30:46,939
Accusations of a kind that
I don't think belong here.

2883
02:30:46,972 --> 02:30:49,142
The witness wrote this letter
on his own initiative,

2884
02:30:49,176 --> 02:30:51,744
laying out evidence that has
already been before the board.

2885
02:30:51,777 --> 02:30:53,380
His conclusions
are valid testimony,

2886
02:30:53,413 --> 02:30:55,315
just like the...
the positive conclusions

2887
02:30:55,348 --> 02:30:56,682
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

2888
02:30:56,715 --> 02:30:58,218
It cuts both ways.

2889
02:30:58,251 --> 02:31:00,686
How long has Counsel been
in possession of this letter?

2890
02:31:00,719 --> 02:31:02,089
I don't think
I should be subject

2891
02:31:02,122 --> 02:31:04,690
to cross-examination by you,
Mr. Garrison.

2892
02:31:04,723 --> 02:31:06,359
Mr. Garrison,
given that we on the board

2893
02:31:06,393 --> 02:31:07,893
have all read the letter,

2894
02:31:07,927 --> 02:31:10,263
wouldn't it be better
to have it in the record?

2895
02:31:10,297 --> 02:31:11,764
Let's proceed.

2896
02:31:13,766 --> 02:31:15,235
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

2897
02:31:15,268 --> 02:31:18,704
"the purpose of this letter
is to state my opinion

2898
02:31:18,737 --> 02:31:20,040
"based upon years of study

2899
02:31:20,073 --> 02:31:22,842
"of the available
classified evidence,

2900
02:31:22,875 --> 02:31:24,910
"that more probably than not,

2901
02:31:24,944 --> 02:31:29,815
"J. Robert Oppenheimer is
an agent of the Soviet Union.

2902
02:31:29,849 --> 02:31:32,185
"The following conclusions
are justified.

2903
02:31:32,219 --> 02:31:37,057
"One, between 1929 and 1942,
more probably than not,

2904
02:31:37,090 --> 02:31:38,391
"J. Robert Oppenheimer

2905
02:31:38,425 --> 02:31:40,726
"was a sufficiently
hardened Communist,

2906
02:31:40,759 --> 02:31:42,862
"that he volunteered
information to the Soviets.

2907
02:31:42,895 --> 02:31:45,232
"Two, more probably than not,

2908
02:31:45,265 --> 02:31:49,835
"he has since been functioning
as an espionage agent.

2909
02:31:49,869 --> 02:31:52,705
"Three, more probably than not,

2910
02:31:52,738 --> 02:31:54,974
"he has since acted
under a Soviet directive

2911
02:31:55,007 --> 02:31:57,743
in influencing United States
military policy..."

2912
02:31:57,776 --> 02:31:59,011
I'm sorry, Robert.

2913
02:31:59,045 --> 02:32:00,380
"...atomic energy, intelligence

2914
02:32:00,413 --> 02:32:01,780
-and diplomatic policy."
-Is anyone

2915
02:32:01,814 --> 02:32:03,450
ever going to tell the truth

2916
02:32:03,483 --> 02:32:05,252
about what's happening here?

2917
02:32:05,285 --> 02:32:08,821
<i>We will now</i>
<i>hear from Dr. David Hill.</i>

2918
02:32:18,064 --> 02:32:19,399
Dr. Hill,

2919
02:32:19,432 --> 02:32:22,068
would you care
to make a statement?

2920
02:32:23,203 --> 02:32:24,770
Thank you.

2921
02:32:24,803 --> 02:32:28,475
I've been asked to testify
about Lewis Strauss.

2922
02:32:28,508 --> 02:32:30,910
A man who has
given years of service

2923
02:32:30,943 --> 02:32:33,913
in high positions of government

2924
02:32:33,946 --> 02:32:38,884
and who is known to be earnest,
hardworking and intelligent.

2925
02:32:39,885 --> 02:32:41,388
The views I have to express
are my own,

2926
02:32:41,421 --> 02:32:45,125
but I believe that much I have
to say will help to indicate

2927
02:32:45,158 --> 02:32:48,861
why most of the scientists
in this country

2928
02:32:48,894 --> 02:32:51,897
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss

2929
02:32:51,931 --> 02:32:53,766
completely out of government.

2930
02:32:55,801 --> 02:32:58,305
You're... You're referring
to the hostility

2931
02:32:58,338 --> 02:32:59,805
of certain scientists

2932
02:32:59,838 --> 02:33:01,474
directed toward Mr. Strauss

2933
02:33:01,508 --> 02:33:03,742
because of his commitment
to security

2934
02:33:03,776 --> 02:33:06,779
as demonstrated
in the Oppenheimer affair?

2935
02:33:09,249 --> 02:33:10,517
No.

2936
02:33:10,550 --> 02:33:12,952
Because of the personal
vindictiveness

2937
02:33:12,985 --> 02:33:15,222
he demonstrated against
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2938
02:33:16,889 --> 02:33:19,024
Order.

2939
02:33:19,059 --> 02:33:20,093
Order!

2940
02:33:20,126 --> 02:33:25,398
It appears to most
scientists around this country

2941
02:33:25,432 --> 02:33:26,966
that Robert Oppenheimer
is now being

2942
02:33:26,999 --> 02:33:29,236
pilloried and put through
an ordeal

2943
02:33:29,269 --> 02:33:32,372
because he expressed
his honest opinions.

2944
02:33:33,373 --> 02:33:35,442
Dr. Bush, I thought
I was performing a service

2945
02:33:35,475 --> 02:33:37,210
to my country
when hearing this case.

2946
02:33:37,244 --> 02:33:41,381
No board in this country
should sit in judgment of a man

2947
02:33:41,414 --> 02:33:44,050
because he expressed
strong opinions.

2948
02:33:44,084 --> 02:33:47,153
If you want to try that case,
you should try me.

2949
02:33:47,187 --> 02:33:51,191
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if I become stirred,

2950
02:33:51,224 --> 02:33:52,425
but I am.

2951
02:33:52,459 --> 02:33:54,427
Dr. Hill, we've already heard

2952
02:33:54,461 --> 02:33:56,895
that Mr. Strauss
did not bring the charges

2953
02:33:56,929 --> 02:33:59,999
or participate in the hearings
against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2954
02:34:00,032 --> 02:34:02,535
The Oppenheimer matter was

2955
02:34:02,569 --> 02:34:04,937
initiated and carried through

2956
02:34:04,970 --> 02:34:07,340
largely through the animus
of Lewis Strauss.

2957
02:34:08,941 --> 02:34:11,578
Oppenheimer made mincemeat
out of Strauss's position

2958
02:34:11,611 --> 02:34:13,213
on the shipment
of isotopes to Norway,

2959
02:34:13,246 --> 02:34:17,250
and Strauss never forgave him
this public humiliation.

2960
02:34:17,284 --> 02:34:19,885
Another controversy between them
centered around

2961
02:34:19,918 --> 02:34:22,888
their differences in judgment
on how the H-bomb

2962
02:34:22,921 --> 02:34:24,990
<i>would contribute</i>
<i>to national security.</i>

2963
02:34:25,024 --> 02:34:26,992
Strauss turned to
the personnel security system

2964
02:34:27,026 --> 02:34:31,264
in order to destroy
Oppenheimer's effectiveness,

2965
02:34:31,298 --> 02:34:33,832
and Strauss was able to find
a few ambitious men

2966
02:34:33,866 --> 02:34:36,902
who also disagreed
with Oppenheimer's positions

2967
02:34:36,935 --> 02:34:39,972
and envied him his prestige
in government circles.

2968
02:34:40,005 --> 02:34:42,609
I've always assumed,
and still assume,

2969
02:34:42,642 --> 02:34:44,877
that he's loyal
to the United States.

2970
02:34:44,910 --> 02:34:46,313
I believe this.
And I shall believe it

2971
02:34:46,346 --> 02:34:48,914
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

2972
02:34:48,947 --> 02:34:50,916
Do you or do you not believe

2973
02:34:50,949 --> 02:34:53,253
that Dr. Oppenheimer
is a security risk?

2974
02:34:56,989 --> 02:34:58,258
In a great number of cases,

2975
02:34:58,291 --> 02:35:00,260
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
act in a way

2976
02:35:00,293 --> 02:35:04,164
which was to me
exceedingly hard to understand.

2977
02:35:04,197 --> 02:35:06,199
I thoroughly disagreed
with him in numerous issues,

2978
02:35:06,232 --> 02:35:08,335
and his actions frankly
appeared to me

2979
02:35:08,368 --> 02:35:09,902
confused and complicated.

2980
02:35:09,935 --> 02:35:11,471
To this extent, I feel,

2981
02:35:11,504 --> 02:35:14,607
I want to see the vital
interest of this country

2982
02:35:14,641 --> 02:35:16,476
in hands which
I understand better

2983
02:35:16,509 --> 02:35:18,645
and therefore trust more.

2984
02:35:18,678 --> 02:35:21,448
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you.

2985
02:35:25,251 --> 02:35:26,353
I'm sorry.

2986
02:35:28,987 --> 02:35:31,157
<i>You shook his fucking hand?</i>

2987
02:35:31,191 --> 02:35:34,094
Oh, I would have
spit in his face.

2988
02:35:34,127 --> 02:35:35,662
Not sure the board
would have appreciated that.

2989
02:35:35,695 --> 02:35:37,263
Is it not
gentlemanly enough for you?

2990
02:35:37,297 --> 02:35:40,633
Well, I-I think you're all being
too goddamn gentlemanly.

2991
02:35:40,667 --> 02:35:42,635
Gray must see
what Robb is doing.

2992
02:35:42,669 --> 02:35:44,604
Why doesn't he just
shut him down?

2993
02:35:44,637 --> 02:35:47,240
And you shaking Teller's hand.

2994
02:35:47,273 --> 02:35:50,143
You need to stop
playing the martyr.

2995
02:35:51,144 --> 02:35:53,546
Under the current
AEC guidelines,

2996
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:55,981
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

2997
02:36:02,155 --> 02:36:04,524
Under my interpretation

2998
02:36:04,557 --> 02:36:06,693
of the Atomic Energy Act,

2999
02:36:06,726 --> 02:36:08,561
which did not exist

3000
02:36:08,595 --> 02:36:11,431
when I hired
Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942...

3001
02:36:12,665 --> 02:36:16,069
I would not clear him today,

3002
02:36:16,102 --> 02:36:18,071
uh, if I were on the commission.

3003
02:36:18,104 --> 02:36:19,672
Good. Thank you, General.
That is all.

3004
02:36:19,706 --> 02:36:21,708
But I don't think I'd clear
any of those guys.

3005
02:36:21,741 --> 02:36:23,909
That's all.

3006
02:36:26,413 --> 02:36:28,548
Dr. Oppenheimer
had no responsibility

3007
02:36:28,581 --> 02:36:30,083
in the selection
or the clearance

3008
02:36:30,116 --> 02:36:31,418
of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

3009
02:36:31,451 --> 02:36:32,719
No. None at all.

3010
02:36:32,752 --> 02:36:34,354
And you wouldn't want
to leave this board

3011
02:36:34,387 --> 02:36:37,157
with any suggestion today
that you're here questioning

3012
02:36:37,190 --> 02:36:39,225
his basic loyalty
to the United States

3013
02:36:39,259 --> 02:36:40,660
in the operation of Los Alamos?

3014
02:36:40,693 --> 02:36:42,262
By no means.

3015
02:36:42,295 --> 02:36:44,297
I hope I didn't lead anyone
to believe otherwise

3016
02:36:44,330 --> 02:36:45,964
for an instant.

3017
02:36:45,998 --> 02:36:47,100
Thank you, General.

3018
02:37:05,151 --> 02:37:07,420
Okay. We shouldn't
keep them waiting.

3019
02:37:07,454 --> 02:37:08,721
She'll be here.

3020
02:37:08,755 --> 02:37:10,190
Do you even want her here?

3021
02:37:10,223 --> 02:37:12,725
Only a fool or an adolescent

3022
02:37:12,759 --> 02:37:14,661
presumes to know
someone else's relationship,

3023
02:37:14,694 --> 02:37:16,995
and you're neither, Lloyd.

3024
02:37:18,565 --> 02:37:20,533
Kitty and I,

3025
02:37:20,567 --> 02:37:22,635
we're grown-ups.

3026
02:37:22,669 --> 02:37:25,505
<i>We've walked</i>
<i>through fire together.</i>

3027
02:37:25,538 --> 02:37:28,107
She'll do fine.

3028
02:37:28,141 --> 02:37:30,210
Would you describe
your views on Communism

3029
02:37:30,243 --> 02:37:32,278
as pro, anti, neutral?

3030
02:37:32,312 --> 02:37:34,180
Very strongly against.

3031
02:37:34,214 --> 02:37:36,349
I-I've had nothing to do
with Communism in... since...

3032
02:37:36,382 --> 02:37:39,219
since 1936, since...

3033
02:37:39,252 --> 02:37:42,121
since before I met Robert.

3034
02:37:42,722 --> 02:37:44,557
That's all.

3035
02:37:44,591 --> 02:37:46,159
<i>The record demonstrates</i>

3036
02:37:46,192 --> 02:37:47,794
<i>that Oppenheimer</i>
<i>was not interrogated</i>

3037
02:37:47,827 --> 02:37:51,064
<i>by impartial and disinterested</i>
<i>counsel for the Gray board.</i>

3038
02:37:51,097 --> 02:37:52,499
<i>He was interrogated</i>
<i>by a prosecutor</i>

3039
02:37:52,532 --> 02:37:54,200
<i>who used all the tricks</i>

3040
02:37:54,234 --> 02:37:56,035
<i>of a rather ingenious</i>
<i>legal background.</i>

3041
02:37:56,069 --> 02:37:57,504
You are charging now

3042
02:37:57,537 --> 02:38:00,507
that the Gray board
permitted a prosecution.

3043
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:03,243
If I were on the Gray board,

3044
02:38:03,276 --> 02:38:05,245
I would have protested
against the tactics

3045
02:38:05,278 --> 02:38:08,181
of the man who served, in fact,
as the prosecuting counsel.

3046
02:38:08,214 --> 02:38:11,417
A man appointed not by the board

3047
02:38:11,451 --> 02:38:13,520
but by Lewis Strauss.

3048
02:38:15,522 --> 02:38:16,556
Who was this?

3049
02:38:17,857 --> 02:38:19,692
I'm sorry?

3050
02:38:19,726 --> 02:38:20,793
Who was this?

3051
02:38:20,827 --> 02:38:22,262
Uh, Roger Robb.

3052
02:38:22,295 --> 02:38:24,631
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

3053
02:38:28,835 --> 02:38:31,271
Did you have a Communist Party
membership card?

3054
02:38:32,705 --> 02:38:34,807
I'm... I'm not sure.

3055
02:38:34,841 --> 02:38:36,342
Not sure?

3056
02:38:39,312 --> 02:38:40,313
Well...

3057
02:38:42,715 --> 02:38:44,450
Well?

3058
02:38:53,393 --> 02:38:56,362
I mean, presumably,
the act of joining the Party

3059
02:38:56,396 --> 02:39:00,166
required sending some money
and receiving a card, no?

3060
02:39:03,336 --> 02:39:04,470
Yeah.

3061
02:39:09,842 --> 02:39:11,244
Sorry.

3062
02:39:11,878 --> 02:39:13,479
Yes. Mm.

3063
02:39:15,315 --> 02:39:17,317
It's just it was all
so very long ago,

3064
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:19,185
-Mr. Robb, wasn't it?
-Not really.

3065
02:39:19,218 --> 02:39:20,453
Long enough to have forgotten.

3066
02:39:20,486 --> 02:39:21,854
Did you return the card
or rip it up?

3067
02:39:21,888 --> 02:39:23,489
The card whose existence
I've forgotten?

3068
02:39:23,523 --> 02:39:25,325
Your Communist Party
membership card.

3069
02:39:25,358 --> 02:39:27,093
Haven't the slightest idea.

3070
02:39:29,395 --> 02:39:32,165
Can a distinction
be made between

3071
02:39:32,198 --> 02:39:33,866
Soviet Communism and Communism?

3072
02:39:33,900 --> 02:39:35,468
Well, in the days
when I was a member,

3073
02:39:35,501 --> 02:39:37,136
I thought they were
definitely two things.

3074
02:39:37,170 --> 02:39:38,438
-Oh?
-I thought that

3075
02:39:38,471 --> 02:39:40,340
the Communist Party
of the United States

3076
02:39:40,373 --> 02:39:42,775
was concerned with
our domestic problems.

3077
02:39:42,809 --> 02:39:44,277
I now no longer believe this.

3078
02:39:44,310 --> 02:39:45,345
Believe the whole thing's
linked together

3079
02:39:45,378 --> 02:39:46,646
and spread all over the world,

3080
02:39:46,679 --> 02:39:48,881
and I have believed this
since I left the Party

3081
02:39:48,915 --> 02:39:50,383
16 years ago.

3082
02:39:50,416 --> 02:39:51,718
-But...
-Seventeen years ago.

3083
02:39:51,751 --> 02:39:53,152
My mistake.

3084
02:39:53,186 --> 02:39:55,822
-But you said...
-Sorry, 18.

3085
02:39:55,855 --> 02:39:58,124
Eighteen years ago.

3086
02:39:58,925 --> 02:40:00,226
Are you familiar with the fact

3087
02:40:00,259 --> 02:40:01,427
your husband was
making contributions

3088
02:40:01,461 --> 02:40:04,530
to the Spanish Civil War
as late as 1942?

3089
02:40:04,564 --> 02:40:06,432
I knew that Robert gave money
from time to time.

3090
02:40:06,466 --> 02:40:07,700
Did you know
this money was going

3091
02:40:07,734 --> 02:40:09,168
into Communist Party channels?

3092
02:40:09,202 --> 02:40:10,637
Don't you mean "through"?

3093
02:40:10,670 --> 02:40:12,438
-Pardon?
-I think you mean

3094
02:40:12,472 --> 02:40:14,273
"through Communist Party
channels," don't you?

3095
02:40:14,307 --> 02:40:15,541
-Y-Yes!
-Yes?

3096
02:40:15,575 --> 02:40:17,477
-Yes!
-Yes.

3097
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:21,214
Then would it be fair to say
that this meant that by 1942,

3098
02:40:21,247 --> 02:40:22,548
your husband had not stopped

3099
02:40:22,582 --> 02:40:24,517
having anything to do
with the Communist Party?

3100
02:40:24,550 --> 02:40:26,352
You don't have
to answer that yes or no.

3101
02:40:26,386 --> 02:40:27,754
You can answer that
any way you wish.

3102
02:40:27,787 --> 02:40:29,656
I know that, thank you.

3103
02:40:29,689 --> 02:40:31,391
It's your question.

3104
02:40:31,424 --> 02:40:33,326
-It's not properly phrased.
-Do you understand

3105
02:40:33,359 --> 02:40:34,594
-what I'm getting at?
-I do.

3106
02:40:34,627 --> 02:40:35,895
Then why don't you
answer it that way?

3107
02:40:35,928 --> 02:40:37,530
'Cause I don't like your phrase.

3108
02:40:37,563 --> 02:40:39,499
"Having anything to do
with the Communist Party."

3109
02:40:39,532 --> 02:40:41,334
Because Robert never
had anything to do

3110
02:40:41,367 --> 02:40:42,669
with the Communist Party
as such.

3111
02:40:42,702 --> 02:40:45,338
I know he gave money
to Spanish refugees.

3112
02:40:45,371 --> 02:40:47,306
I know he took
an intellectual interest

3113
02:40:47,340 --> 02:40:48,541
in Communist ideas...

3114
02:40:48,574 --> 02:40:49,676
Are there two types
of Communists?

3115
02:40:49,709 --> 02:40:51,411
Intellectual Communists

3116
02:40:51,444 --> 02:40:53,379
and your plain old
regular Commie?

3117
02:40:54,380 --> 02:40:55,948
Well, I couldn't
answer that one.

3118
02:40:55,982 --> 02:40:58,751
I couldn't either.

3119
02:41:04,891 --> 02:41:06,693
Evening.

3120
02:41:06,726 --> 02:41:08,461
Robert,
you can't win this thing.

3121
02:41:08,494 --> 02:41:10,430
It's a kangaroo court
with a predetermined outcome.

3122
02:41:10,463 --> 02:41:12,398
Why put yourself
through more of it?

3123
02:41:12,999 --> 02:41:15,435
I have my reasons.

3124
02:41:16,036 --> 02:41:17,470
All right.

3125
02:41:17,503 --> 02:41:18,638
Good night.

3126
02:41:23,342 --> 02:41:24,744
He has a point.

3127
02:41:25,678 --> 02:41:27,714
I'm not sure
you understand, Albert.

3128
02:41:27,747 --> 02:41:28,848
No?

3129
02:41:28,881 --> 02:41:32,385
I left my country
never to return.

3130
02:41:33,019 --> 02:41:34,987
You served your country well.

3131
02:41:35,021 --> 02:41:38,658
If this is the reward
she offers you, then...

3132
02:41:38,691 --> 02:41:42,328
perhaps you should
turn your back on her.

3133
02:41:42,361 --> 02:41:44,997
Damn it, I happen
to love this country.

3134
02:41:45,031 --> 02:41:47,633
Then tell them to go to hell.

3135
02:41:47,667 --> 02:41:48,568
Interestingly enough,

3136
02:41:48,601 --> 02:41:51,671
this is no longer
a confirmation hearing,

3137
02:41:51,704 --> 02:41:53,873
it's now a trial...

3138
02:41:53,906 --> 02:41:55,641
about a trial!

3139
02:41:56,642 --> 02:41:57,944
It's not good
he's telling everyone

3140
02:41:57,977 --> 02:41:59,278
you initiated the hearings.

3141
02:41:59,312 --> 02:42:01,681
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

3142
02:42:01,714 --> 02:42:04,383
He certainly can't prove
that I gave the file to Borden.

3143
02:42:04,417 --> 02:42:06,753
We're not in court, sir.

3144
02:42:06,786 --> 02:42:07,987
There's no burden of proof.

3145
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:10,389
Right. They're not convicting...

3146
02:42:10,423 --> 02:42:11,691
just denying.

3147
02:42:11,724 --> 02:42:14,627
Why would Hill come here
to tear me down?

3148
02:42:14,660 --> 02:42:16,295
What's his angle?

3149
02:42:16,329 --> 02:42:18,431
Do people need a reason
to do the right thing?

3150
02:42:18,464 --> 02:42:20,067
-As he sees it.
-I told you,

3151
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:22,769
Oppenheimer poisoned
the scientists against me,

3152
02:42:22,802 --> 02:42:24,504
right from that first meeting.

3153
02:42:24,537 --> 02:42:27,774
<i>I don't know what Oppenheimer</i>
<i>said to him that day,</i>

3154
02:42:27,807 --> 02:42:30,543
but Einstein wouldn't
even meet my eye.

3155
02:42:31,644 --> 02:42:34,747
<i>Oppenheimer knows</i>
<i>how to manipulate his own.</i>

3156
02:42:34,781 --> 02:42:36,049
And at Los Alamos,

3157
02:42:36,083 --> 02:42:38,417
he preyed
on the naivete of scientists

3158
02:42:38,451 --> 02:42:40,753
who thought they'd get a say
in how we used their work,

3159
02:42:40,787 --> 02:42:43,790
but don't ever think
he was that naive himself.

3160
02:42:43,823 --> 02:42:45,092
Doctor.

3161
02:42:45,125 --> 02:42:47,094
During your work
on the hydrogen bomb,

3162
02:42:47,127 --> 02:42:50,797
were you deterred
by any moral qualms?

3163
02:42:50,830 --> 02:42:52,465
Yes, of course.

3164
02:42:52,498 --> 02:42:53,800
But you still got on
with your work, didn't you?

3165
02:42:53,833 --> 02:42:56,069
Yes, because this was
work of exploration,

3166
02:42:56,103 --> 02:42:58,337
it was not the preparation
of a weapon.

3167
02:42:58,371 --> 02:43:00,439
You mean it was more of a...
an academic excursion.

3168
02:43:00,473 --> 02:43:02,375
No, it is not an academic thing

3169
02:43:02,408 --> 02:43:03,810
whether you can build
a hydrogen bomb.

3170
02:43:03,843 --> 02:43:05,444
It's a matter of life and death.

3171
02:43:05,478 --> 02:43:06,846
By 1942, you were
actively pushing

3172
02:43:06,879 --> 02:43:08,447
the development of
the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

3173
02:43:08,481 --> 02:43:09,715
Pushing's not the right word.

3174
02:43:09,749 --> 02:43:11,684
Supporting it
and working on it, yes.

3175
02:43:11,717 --> 02:43:14,054
So when did these moral qualms
become so strong

3176
02:43:14,087 --> 02:43:15,721
that you actively opposed

3177
02:43:15,755 --> 02:43:17,423
the development
of the hydrogen bomb?

3178
02:43:17,456 --> 02:43:19,425
When it was suggested
that it be the policy

3179
02:43:19,458 --> 02:43:21,627
of the United States to make
these things at all cost

3180
02:43:21,661 --> 02:43:23,663
without regard to the balance
between these weapons

3181
02:43:23,696 --> 02:43:26,766
and atomic weapons
as part of our arsenal.

3182
02:43:28,135 --> 02:43:30,070
What do moral qualms
have to do with that?

3183
02:43:30,103 --> 02:43:32,139
Wha... What do moral qualms

3184
02:43:32,172 --> 02:43:33,706
-have to do with it?
-Yes.

3185
02:43:33,739 --> 02:43:35,808
Oppenheimer wanted
to own the atomic bomb.

3186
02:43:35,842 --> 02:43:37,743
He wanted to be the man
who moved the Earth.

3187
02:43:37,777 --> 02:43:40,947
He talks about
putting the nuclear genie

3188
02:43:40,980 --> 02:43:42,448
back in the bottle.

3189
02:43:42,481 --> 02:43:43,616
Well, I'm here to tell you

3190
02:43:43,649 --> 02:43:45,852
that I know
J. Robert Oppenheimer,

3191
02:43:45,885 --> 02:43:49,989
and if he could do it all over,
he'd do it all the same.

3192
02:43:50,022 --> 02:43:53,060
You know he's never once said
that he regrets Hiroshima?

3193
02:43:53,093 --> 02:43:55,962
He'd do it all over. Why?

3194
02:43:55,995 --> 02:43:57,430
Because it made him

3195
02:43:57,463 --> 02:43:59,099
the most important man
who ever lived.

3196
02:43:59,132 --> 02:44:01,467
Well, we've...

3197
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:03,603
we've freely used
the atomic bomb...

3198
02:44:03,636 --> 02:44:05,738
In fact, Doctor,
you assisted in selecting

3199
02:44:05,771 --> 02:44:07,174
the target to drop
the atomic bomb on Japan,

3200
02:44:07,207 --> 02:44:08,875
-didn't you?
-Yes.

3201
02:44:08,908 --> 02:44:10,543
Well, then you knew,
did you not, that by dropping

3202
02:44:10,576 --> 02:44:12,745
that atomic bomb
on the target you selected,

3203
02:44:12,778 --> 02:44:14,181
that thousands of civilians
would be killed

3204
02:44:14,214 --> 02:44:15,948
or injured, is that correct?

3205
02:44:15,982 --> 02:44:17,884
Yes, not as many
as turned out...

3206
02:44:17,917 --> 02:44:20,120
Oh. Well, how many
were killed or injured?

3207
02:44:20,153 --> 02:44:22,021
-70,000.
-70,000

3208
02:44:22,055 --> 02:44:23,123
at both Hiroshima and...

3209
02:44:23,156 --> 02:44:24,590
110,000 at both.

3210
02:44:24,624 --> 02:44:26,025
On the day of each bombing?

3211
02:44:27,994 --> 02:44:29,162
Yes.

3212
02:44:29,196 --> 02:44:30,763
And in the weeks
and years that followed?

3213
02:44:30,796 --> 02:44:33,499
It has been put at somewhere
between 50 and 100,000.

3214
02:44:33,532 --> 02:44:35,635
-220,000 dead at least?
-Yes.

3215
02:44:35,668 --> 02:44:37,570
Any moral scruples about that?

3216
02:44:38,938 --> 02:44:40,040
Terrible ones.

3217
02:44:40,073 --> 02:44:41,641
But yet you testified in here

3218
02:44:41,674 --> 02:44:44,044
that the bombing of Hiroshima
was very successful.

3219
02:44:44,077 --> 02:44:45,645
-Technically successful.
-Oh!

3220
02:44:45,678 --> 02:44:47,446
Technically, it was
very successful.

3221
02:44:47,480 --> 02:44:48,948
And it is also alleged
to have helped end the war.

3222
02:44:48,981 --> 02:44:50,950
Would you have been
in support of the dropping

3223
02:44:50,983 --> 02:44:52,919
of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

3224
02:44:52,952 --> 02:44:54,487
That would make no sense at all.

3225
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:56,956
-Why?
-The-the target is too small.

3226
02:44:56,989 --> 02:44:59,492
Well, supposing there had been
a target in Japan

3227
02:44:59,525 --> 02:45:00,993
big enough for
a thermonuclear weapon,

3228
02:45:01,027 --> 02:45:02,795
would you have been opposed
to the dropping of it?

3229
02:45:02,828 --> 02:45:04,664
This was not a problem
with which I was confronted...

3230
02:45:04,697 --> 02:45:06,133
Well, I'm confronting you
with it now, sir.

3231
02:45:06,166 --> 02:45:07,934
It was all part of his plan.

3232
02:45:07,967 --> 02:45:09,535
He wanted the glorious,

3233
02:45:09,568 --> 02:45:11,737
insincere guilt
of the self-important

3234
02:45:11,771 --> 02:45:13,240
to wear like a fuckin' crown.

3235
02:45:13,273 --> 02:45:16,709
Say, "No, we cannot
go down this road,"

3236
02:45:16,742 --> 02:45:19,545
even as he knew we'd have to.

3237
02:45:19,578 --> 02:45:21,114
Would you have been opposed
to the dropping

3238
02:45:21,148 --> 02:45:22,815
of a thermonuclear weapon
on Japan

3239
02:45:22,848 --> 02:45:25,085
-because of moral scruples?
-Yes, I believe I would, sir.

3240
02:45:25,118 --> 02:45:26,819
Well, did you oppose
the dropping

3241
02:45:26,852 --> 02:45:28,854
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima
because of moral scruples?

3242
02:45:28,888 --> 02:45:30,523
We set forth our arguments...

3243
02:45:30,556 --> 02:45:31,958
No, you, you, you.
I'm asking you.

3244
02:45:31,991 --> 02:45:33,626
-I set... I set forth...
-Not we. You, you, you!

3245
02:45:33,659 --> 02:45:35,262
...our arguments
against dropping it,

3246
02:45:35,295 --> 02:45:36,829
but I did not endorse them.

3247
02:45:36,862 --> 02:45:38,564
You mean after
working night and day

3248
02:45:38,597 --> 02:45:39,966
for three years
building the bomb,

3249
02:45:39,999 --> 02:45:41,834
you then argued against
the use of it?

3250
02:45:41,867 --> 02:45:44,570
I was asked
by the Secretary of War

3251
02:45:44,603 --> 02:45:45,972
what the views
of scientists were.

3252
02:45:46,005 --> 02:45:48,741
I gave him the views against
and the views for.

3253
02:45:48,774 --> 02:45:50,776
You supported the dropping
of the atom bomb on Japan.

3254
02:45:50,810 --> 02:45:52,279
-What do you mean "support"?
-Didn't you?

3255
02:45:52,312 --> 02:45:53,779
-You supported it!
-What do you mean "support"?

3256
02:45:53,813 --> 02:45:55,148
Well, you helped
pick the target, didn't you?

3257
02:45:55,182 --> 02:45:56,816
I did my job.

3258
02:45:56,849 --> 02:45:58,584
I was not in a policy-making
position at Los Alamos.

3259
02:45:58,617 --> 02:46:00,253
I would have done anything
I was asked to do.

3260
02:46:00,287 --> 02:46:02,555
Well, then you would have
built the H-bomb too,

3261
02:46:02,588 --> 02:46:03,723
-wouldn't you?
-I couldn't.

3262
02:46:03,756 --> 02:46:05,658
I didn't ask you that, Doctor!

3263
02:46:05,691 --> 02:46:08,027
And the GAC report
which you co-authored

3264
02:46:08,061 --> 02:46:09,929
after the Soviet
atomic test said

3265
02:46:09,962 --> 02:46:12,631
a Super bomb
should never be built!

3266
02:46:12,665 --> 02:46:14,000
What we meant,
what I meant was...

3267
02:46:14,033 --> 02:46:16,103
-What you, who? Who?
-What I meant...

3268
02:46:17,870 --> 02:46:19,306
And wouldn't the Russians
do anything

3269
02:46:19,339 --> 02:46:21,607
to increase their strength?

3270
02:46:21,640 --> 02:46:23,609
If we did it,
they would have to do it.

3271
02:46:23,642 --> 02:46:25,678
Our efforts would only
fuel their efforts,

3272
02:46:25,711 --> 02:46:27,813
just as it had
with the atomic bomb.

3273
02:46:27,847 --> 02:46:31,251
"Just as it had with
the atomic bomb," exactly!

3274
02:46:31,284 --> 02:46:36,022
No moral scruples in 1945,
plenty in 1949.

3275
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:41,994
Dr. Oppenheimer...

3276
02:46:43,662 --> 02:46:46,266
...when did your strong
moral convictions develop

3277
02:46:46,299 --> 02:46:49,102
with respect
to the hydrogen bomb?

3278
02:46:56,143 --> 02:46:59,046
When it became clear to me

3279
02:46:59,079 --> 02:47:02,715
that we would tend to use
any weapon we had.

3280
02:47:05,152 --> 02:47:07,653
<i>J. Robert Oppenheimer,</i>
<i>the martyr.</i>

3281
02:47:07,686 --> 02:47:10,290
I gave him exactly
what he wanted.

3282
02:47:10,323 --> 02:47:12,591
To be remembered for Trinity,

3283
02:47:12,625 --> 02:47:15,228
not Hiroshima,

3284
02:47:15,262 --> 02:47:17,696
not Nagasaki.

3285
02:47:20,233 --> 02:47:22,935
He should be thanking me.

3286
02:47:22,968 --> 02:47:25,905
Well, he's not.

3287
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:29,342
Do we still have enough votes,

3288
02:47:29,376 --> 02:47:31,044
or is the crowning moment
of my career

3289
02:47:31,078 --> 02:47:35,215
about to become the most public
humiliation of my life?

3290
02:47:35,248 --> 02:47:37,817
Full Senate's about to vote.

3291
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:39,018
You'll scrape through.

3292
02:47:39,052 --> 02:47:40,686
Great, then gather
the fucking press.

3293
02:47:40,719 --> 02:47:42,688
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

3294
02:47:42,721 --> 02:47:45,691
This board, having heard
testimony from you

3295
02:47:45,724 --> 02:47:48,861
and many of your current
and former colleagues,

3296
02:47:48,894 --> 02:47:50,896
has come to
the unanimous conclusion

3297
02:47:50,930 --> 02:47:54,033
that you are a loyal citizen.

3298
02:47:55,335 --> 02:47:56,969
However,

3299
02:47:57,002 --> 02:48:00,639
in the light of
your continuing associations

3300
02:48:00,673 --> 02:48:01,941
and disregard

3301
02:48:01,974 --> 02:48:04,111
for the security apparatus
of this country,

3302
02:48:04,144 --> 02:48:07,680
together with your
somewhat disturbing conduct

3303
02:48:07,713 --> 02:48:10,250
on the hydrogen bomb program

3304
02:48:10,283 --> 02:48:11,817
and the regrettable
lack of candor

3305
02:48:11,851 --> 02:48:14,221
in certain of your responses
to this board,

3306
02:48:14,254 --> 02:48:17,124
we have voted two to one

3307
02:48:17,157 --> 02:48:20,260
to deny the renewal
of your security clearance.

3308
02:48:20,293 --> 02:48:23,396
A full written opinion,
with a dissent from Mr. Evans,

3309
02:48:23,430 --> 02:48:26,932
will be issued to the AEC
in the coming days.

3310
02:48:26,966 --> 02:48:28,634
That is all.

3311
02:48:32,405 --> 02:48:33,739
-Gordon...
-Roger.

3312
02:48:38,777 --> 02:48:40,679
<i>Robert.</i>

3313
02:48:41,314 --> 02:48:42,848
Robert.

3314
02:48:45,318 --> 02:48:46,819
Don't...

3315
02:48:49,189 --> 02:48:52,392
Don't take in the sheets.

3316
02:48:53,792 --> 02:48:55,195
Get a picture with him.

3317
02:48:55,228 --> 02:48:56,463
Sir, sir.

3318
02:48:56,496 --> 02:48:58,964
Two minutes. Two minutes.

3319
02:48:58,998 --> 02:49:00,200
-You'll get your shot.
-Please, sir.

3320
02:49:00,233 --> 02:49:01,800
We've been waiting for so long.

3321
02:49:01,834 --> 02:49:02,835
-Evening, sir.
-Come out.

3322
02:49:02,868 --> 02:49:03,903
Sir, sir!

3323
02:49:03,936 --> 02:49:05,272
Is it official?

3324
02:49:07,374 --> 02:49:08,774
Well, there were,

3325
02:49:08,807 --> 02:49:11,944
uh, a couple
of unexpected holdouts.

3326
02:49:16,383 --> 02:49:19,052
I'm denied. Yeah?

3327
02:49:19,085 --> 02:49:21,054
-I'm afraid so, sir.
-All right.

3328
02:49:28,761 --> 02:49:29,828
Who were the holdouts?

3329
02:49:29,862 --> 02:49:32,798
Um, there were three,

3330
02:49:32,831 --> 02:49:35,768
led by the junior senator
from Massachusetts.

3331
02:49:35,801 --> 02:49:37,204
Young guy trying
to make a name for himself,

3332
02:49:37,237 --> 02:49:39,805
didn't like what you did
to Oppenheimer.

3333
02:49:39,838 --> 02:49:40,973
What's his name?

3334
02:49:41,006 --> 02:49:43,210
Uh, Kennedy.

3335
02:49:43,243 --> 02:49:45,045
John F. Kennedy.

3336
02:49:48,515 --> 02:49:49,915
Kitty?

3337
02:49:55,988 --> 02:49:59,392
Did you think that if you
let them tar and feather you,

3338
02:49:59,426 --> 02:50:01,994
that the world
would forgive you?

3339
02:50:05,532 --> 02:50:06,966
It won't.

3340
02:50:09,336 --> 02:50:10,736
We'll see.

3341
02:50:20,513 --> 02:50:22,515
Goddamn it.

3342
02:50:24,050 --> 02:50:26,986
You told me I'd be okay.

3343
02:50:27,019 --> 02:50:29,389
Yeah, well, I didn't have
all the facts, did I?

3344
02:50:29,422 --> 02:50:30,990
Here's a fact.

3345
02:50:31,023 --> 02:50:32,858
President Eisenhower pinned
the Medal of Freedom

3346
02:50:32,891 --> 02:50:34,327
on my chest last year

3347
02:50:34,361 --> 02:50:36,862
'cause I've always done
what's right for this country.

3348
02:50:36,895 --> 02:50:39,399
They don't want me
in the Cabinet room?

3349
02:50:39,432 --> 02:50:41,867
Well, that's... that's fine.

3350
02:50:41,900 --> 02:50:44,237
Maybe they should just
invite Oppenheimer instead.

3351
02:50:44,271 --> 02:50:45,305
Maybe they will.

3352
02:50:46,306 --> 02:50:47,540
I told you,

3353
02:50:47,574 --> 02:50:50,210
he turned the scientists
against me one by one,

3354
02:50:50,243 --> 02:50:52,412
starting with Einstein.
I told you about, uh, Einstein.

3355
02:50:52,445 --> 02:50:53,879
I saw him by the pond.

3356
02:50:53,912 --> 02:50:55,415
You did, but you know, sir,

3357
02:50:55,448 --> 02:50:57,450
since nobody really knows

3358
02:50:57,484 --> 02:50:59,119
what they said
to each other that day,

3359
02:50:59,152 --> 02:51:03,189
is it possible they didn't
talk about you at all?

3360
02:51:03,223 --> 02:51:06,359
Is it possible they spoke
about something, uh,

3361
02:51:06,393 --> 02:51:07,826
more important?

3362
02:51:07,860 --> 02:51:09,296
Mr. Strauss!

3363
02:51:12,632 --> 02:51:15,034
Over here! Mr. Strauss!

3364
02:51:18,171 --> 02:51:21,441
Oh.

3365
02:51:22,609 --> 02:51:23,909
Thank you.

3366
02:51:23,942 --> 02:51:26,446
Albert.

3367
02:51:26,479 --> 02:51:28,448
Ah.

3368
02:51:28,481 --> 02:51:30,983
The man of the moment.

3369
02:51:34,087 --> 02:51:37,457
You once held
a-a reception for me.

3370
02:51:37,490 --> 02:51:39,292
In Berkeley.
You gave me an award.

3371
02:51:39,326 --> 02:51:41,194
-Hmm?
-Yes.

3372
02:51:42,095 --> 02:51:44,497
You all thought that
I had lost the ability

3373
02:51:44,531 --> 02:51:47,467
to understand what I'd started.

3374
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:50,936
So the award
really wasn't for me,

3375
02:51:50,969 --> 02:51:53,373
it was for all of you, hmm?

3376
02:51:55,241 --> 02:51:57,243
Now it's your turn

3377
02:51:57,277 --> 02:52:01,980
to deal with the consequences
of your achievement.

3378
02:52:02,915 --> 02:52:04,217
And one day,

3379
02:52:04,250 --> 02:52:06,885
when they've
punished you enough...

3380
02:52:08,288 --> 02:52:12,192
...they'll serve you
salmon and potato salad.

3381
02:52:15,928 --> 02:52:17,963
Make speeches...

3382
02:52:18,997 --> 02:52:20,500
<i>...give you a medal.</i>

3383
02:52:22,202 --> 02:52:24,371
Hello, Frank.

3384
02:52:24,404 --> 02:52:25,638
You're happy, I'm happy.

3385
02:52:32,612 --> 02:52:35,948
<i>Pat you on the back,</i>
<i>tell you all is forgiven.</i>

3386
02:52:37,484 --> 02:52:39,885
<i>Just remember...</i>

3387
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:42,389
<i>...it won't be for you.</i>

3388
02:52:46,659 --> 02:52:48,294
<i>It'll be for them.</i>

3389
02:53:02,442 --> 02:53:03,976
Albert.

3390
02:53:05,211 --> 02:53:08,681
When I came to you
with those calculations,

3391
02:53:08,715 --> 02:53:10,949
we thought we might
start a chain reaction

3392
02:53:10,983 --> 02:53:14,454
that would destroy
the entire world.

3393
02:53:14,487 --> 02:53:17,956
Mm, I remember it well.

3394
02:53:17,990 --> 02:53:20,059
What of it?

3395
02:53:22,695 --> 02:53:24,431
I believe we did.
