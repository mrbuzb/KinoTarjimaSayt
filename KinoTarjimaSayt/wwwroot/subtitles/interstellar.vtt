347
00:26:47,544 --> 00:26:48,585
Hello, Cooper.

348
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:51,088
Professor Brand.

349
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:55,217
MAN:
Explain to me how you found this facility.

350
00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:58,679
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

351
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:01,557
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

352
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:05,227
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

353
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:07,229
BRAND:
Cooper, please.

354
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:09,773
Cooperate with these people.

355
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:11,150
Look.

356
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:13,736
It's kind of hard to explain.

357
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,240
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

358
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,326
What sort of anomaly?

359
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:23,787
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

360
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:27,875
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

361
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:29,293
It was gravity.

362
00:27:32,964 --> 00:27:37,176
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

363
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,637
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

364
00:27:40,805 --> 00:27:44,016
but you're not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

365
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,476
- Assurances?
COOPER: Yeah.

366
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:49,772
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

367
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:51,607
[ALL LAUGH]

368
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,443
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

369
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:55,861
No, professor, I don't.

00:27:58,656 --> 00:27:59,948
We're NASA.

372
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:03,952
- NASA?
BRAND: NASA.

373
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:06,080
The same NASA you flew for.

374
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:18,801
COOPER:
I heard they shut you down, sir...

375
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:21,261
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere...

376
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:22,971
onto starving people.

377
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:25,474
When they realized
that killing other people was...

378
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:28,477
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

379
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:30,646
- In secret.
- Why secret?

380
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:34,650
BRAND: Because public opinion wouldn't
allow spending on space exploration.

381
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,403
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

382
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:39,988
Blight.

383
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:44,284
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

384
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:46,703
Now there's just corn.

385
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:48,997
And we're growing more than we ever have.

386
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:53,335
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

387
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,422
the corn will die.

388
00:28:57,173 --> 00:28:58,215
Soon.

389
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,345
[COOPER SIGHS]

390
00:29:03,513 --> 00:29:07,099
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.

391
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:11,854
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

392
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:14,231
Not just ours, no.

393
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:16,358
But it is our home.

394
00:29:17,694 --> 00:29:21,029
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

395
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:22,906
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

396
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:28,412
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

397
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,040
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

398
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:34,376

399
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:38,297
will be the last to survive on Earth.

400
00:29:38,465 --> 00:29:42,050
WOMAN: Murph is tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

401
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:44,052
Yeah. Thank you.

402
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:47,890
Okay...

403
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:52,394
now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

404
00:29:53,062 --> 00:29:56,565
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

405
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:03,447
COOPER:
Rangers.

406
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,702
The last components of our one versatile
ship in orbit, the Endurance.

407
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:10,621
Our final expedition.

408
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:14,374
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

409
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,293
The Lazarus missions.

410
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:19,588
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

411
00:30:19,923 --> 00:30:21,924
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

412
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,260
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

413
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:27,930
and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

414
00:30:28,097 --> 00:30:30,766
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

415
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:33,769
Where'd you send them?

416
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:35,604
Cooper...

417
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:38,565
I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree...

418
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,567
to pilot this craft.

419
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:44,029
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

420
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:46,448
This team never left the simulator.

421
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:50,577
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

422
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:52,246
Without even knowing it?

423
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:57,543
An hour ago, you didn't even know I
was alive. You were going anyway.

424
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,419
We had no choice.

425
00:30:59,587 --> 00:31:01,338
But something sent you here.

426
00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:04,383
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

427
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,268
How long would I be gone?

428
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:17,771
Hard to know. Years?

429
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:20,107
I've got kids, professor.

430
00:31:20,608 --> 00:31:22,651
Get out there and save them.

431
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,406
Who's "they"?

432
00:31:27,574 --> 00:31:31,368
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

433
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:35,330
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

434
00:31:35,498 --> 00:31:38,625
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

435
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:41,295
Yeah, over the Straights.

436
00:31:42,297 --> 00:31:45,340
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

437
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:46,717
Exactly.

438
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:52,472
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

439
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,641
Out near Saturn...

440
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:56,893
a disturbance of space-time.

441
00:31:59,022 --> 00:32:02,149
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

442
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:04,526
And it leads where?

443
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:06,695
Another galaxy.

444
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,699
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

445
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,284
Someone placed it there.

446
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:14,578
- "They"?
- Mm.

447
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:19,166
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

448
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:22,210
That wormhole lets us
travel to other stars.

449
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:24,296
It came along right as we needed it.

450
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:27,382
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

451
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,468
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

452
00:32:29,636 --> 00:32:32,012
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

453
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,182
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

454
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:38,185
The Lazarus missions.

455
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,759
BRAND:
Twelve possible worlds...

456
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:42,230
twelve Ranger launches carrying...

457
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,108
the bravest humans ever to live...

458
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:47,903
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

459
00:32:48,404 --> 00:32:51,406
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

460
00:32:51,574 --> 00:32:53,533
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

461
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:56,912
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

462
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,916
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

463
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,671
then they could send out a signal, bed
down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

464
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:07,881
And what if the world didn't show promise?

465
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:09,925
Hence the bravery.

466
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:13,261
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

467
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:14,554
No.

468
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:18,225
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

469
00:33:18,393 --> 00:33:23,438
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

470
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:25,399
And one system shows promise.

471
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:28,276
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

472
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:31,947
One system with three potential worlds?

473
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:33,949
No long shot.

474
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,244
Okay.

475
00:33:37,954 --> 00:33:40,288
So if we find a home...

476
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:46,420
- then what?
- That's the long shot.

477
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:49,965
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

478
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:53,427
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

479
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:08,066
COOPER:
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

480
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:10,902
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

481
00:34:11,237 --> 00:34:12,988
BRAND:
Both. Plan A.

482
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:15,240
How do you get it off the ground?

483
00:34:15,408 --> 00:34:19,077
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

484
00:34:19,412 --> 00:34:23,749
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

485
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:28,754
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

486
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,214
But you haven't solved it yet.

487
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,842
That's why there's Plan B.

488
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:39,055
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable
amount of human life off the planet.

489
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:40,515
This is one way.

490
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,351
Plan B: a population bomb.

491
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:48,440
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

492
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,650
How would you raise them?

493
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:53,278
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

494
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:57,324
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

495
00:34:58,034 --> 00:35:01,328
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

496
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:04,873
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

497
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,042
This takes care of that.

498
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,669
But what about the people here? You just...

499
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:11,379
give up on them?

500
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:13,256
My kids?

501
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,135
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

502
00:35:19,388 --> 00:35:22,265
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

503
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:24,851
You're asking me to hang everything...

504
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:27,229
on an almost.

505
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:30,065
I'm asking you to trust me.

506
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:32,984

00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:40,826
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

Go! If you're leaving, just go.

514
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:18,238
DONALD: This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

515
00:36:19,073 --> 00:36:22,826
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

516
00:36:23,786 --> 00:36:25,620
And it excites me? Heh.

517
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,790
No, that does not make it wrong.

518
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,083
It might.

519
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:33,587
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

520
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:36,673
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

521
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,925
And the foundation's solid.

522
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:47,100
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

523
00:36:47,393 --> 00:36:48,643
"Next year."

524
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:52,981
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

525
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:57,944
This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's
been telling us to leave for a while now.

526
00:37:02,658 --> 00:37:06,453
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

527
00:37:09,582 --> 00:37:12,792
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

528
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,002
I will.

529
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:18,131
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

530
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:30,769
You have to talk to me, Murph.

531
00:37:33,272 --> 00:37:35,398
I need to fix this before I go.

532
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:38,443
MURPH: Then I'll keep it
broken so you have to stay.

533
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:45,033
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

534
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:47,035
She said, "Now...

535
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:53,416
we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

536
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:01,049
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

537
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:08,556
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

538
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:12,352
You said ghosts didn't exist.

539
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:20,318
That's right, Murph.

540
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:24,864
Murph, look at me.

541
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,412
I can't be your ghost right now.

542
00:38:32,206 --> 00:38:34,207
I need to exist.

543
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:37,752
They chose me.

544
00:38:38,462 --> 00:38:42,424
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

545
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:47,554
That's exactly why you can't go.

546
00:38:50,766 --> 00:38:52,726
I figured out the message.

547
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:56,354
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

548
00:38:56,522 --> 00:38:57,856
"Stay."

549
00:38:58,232 --> 00:39:01,109
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

550
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:03,528
You don't believe me.

551
00:39:03,696 --> 00:39:06,489
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

552
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:09,617
Why...? You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

553
00:39:09,952 --> 00:39:11,786
No, I'm coming back.

554
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:13,288
When?

555
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:28,762
One for you, one for me.

556
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:32,307
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

557
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:35,185
traveling near the speed of light, or...

558
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:38,313
near a black hole...

559
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:43,318
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

560
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:46,696
When we get back...

561
00:39:47,823 --> 00:39:49,240
we're gonna compare.

562
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:52,035
MURPH: Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

563
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,791
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

564
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,502
"What?" Imagine that!

565
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:06,216
Aw, Murph...

566
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:09,010
You have no idea when you're coming back.

567
00:40:10,805 --> 00:40:12,305
No idea at all!

568
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:17,560
Murph, don't... Don't
make me leave like this.

569
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:19,229
Come on, Murph!

570
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,065
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

571
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:30,698
Hey...

572
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:32,575
I love you.

573
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,869
Forever. You hear me?

574
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:38,540
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

575
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:45,672
I'm coming back.

576
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:06,067
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

577
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:08,278
Just fine.

578
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:15,869
I love you, Tom.

579
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:18,538
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

580
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:20,957
You look after our place for me, all right?

581
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,750
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

582
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:30,633
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

583
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:33,761
I'll make sure they bring it back.

584
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,682
Look after my kids, Donald!

585
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:53,781
TARS:
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

586
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,534
- Dad!
- Nine...

587
00:41:56,702 --> 00:41:57,952
Dad!

588
00:41:58,579 --> 00:41:59,621
Eight...

589
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:02,040
seven...

590
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,458
Dad!

591
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:04,834
Six...

592
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:09,130
five, main engine start, four...

593
00:42:10,466 --> 00:42:11,633
three...

594
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:13,426
two...

595
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:16,429
one. Booster ignition and...

596
00:42:25,898 --> 00:42:28,358
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

597
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:35,490
Prepare for stage one separation.

598
00:42:35,824 --> 00:42:36,866
Stage one.

599
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:44,666
There is Mach 1.

600
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:49,337
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

601
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:54,509
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

602
00:42:54,843 --> 00:42:56,511
He thinks it relaxes us.

603
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,472
A giant sarcastic robot.

604
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:01,766
What a great idea!

605
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,644
TARS: I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

606
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:05,853
That'd probably help.

607
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:09,941
You can use it to find your way back to the
ship after I blow you out the airlock.

608
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:14,028
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

609
00:43:14,196 --> 00:43:15,989
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

610
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,157
TARS:
Stage two separation.

611
00:43:28,836 --> 00:43:31,004
COOPER:
All feeds going manual.

612
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:32,714
MAN:
Going manual.

613
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:37,176
COOPER:
Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.

614
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:38,386
MAN:
Check.

615
00:43:43,976 --> 00:43:46,894
- Taking control.
TARS: This is handover to you.

616
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:53,026
MAN: A.D.F. check.
COOPER: Over.

617
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,030
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

618
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:58,531
MAN:
One hundred percent.

619
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:00,533
COOPER:
Ex-mites.

620
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:11,336
It's hard leaving everything.

621
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:14,213
My kids. Your father.

622
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,216
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

623
00:44:17,384 --> 00:44:20,428
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

624
00:44:22,723 --> 00:44:24,265
Just being honest.

625
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:26,768
I don't think you need to be that honest.

626
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:29,604
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

627
00:44:29,772 --> 00:44:32,398
TARS: Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

628
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:35,610
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

629
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:38,363
safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

630
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,989
Okay.

631
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:43,076
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

632
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:49,999
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

633
00:45:07,101 --> 00:45:09,102
Okay. Taking control.

634
00:45:12,564 --> 00:45:15,441
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

635
00:45:28,455 --> 00:45:29,580
It's all you, Doyle.

636
00:45:48,142 --> 00:45:50,601
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

637
00:45:55,774 --> 00:45:57,024
I feel good.

638
00:45:57,192 --> 00:45:58,359
Take us home.

639
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:00,194
[BEEPING]

640
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,494
- Lock.
- Target locked.

641
00:46:08,662 --> 00:46:10,496
COOPER: Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

642
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:11,706
Good job.

643
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:46,908
Door's not charging.

644
00:46:47,075 --> 00:46:48,576
Never mind.

645
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,059
Cooper, you should have control.

646
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:14,894
Control here.

647
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,940
Communication with ring module active.

648
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:26,948
WOMAN:
Oh, wow.

649
00:47:32,746 --> 00:47:33,913
TARS:
That's initiate.

650
00:47:41,463 --> 00:47:43,965
COOPER: Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

651
00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:57,728
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

652
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:00,606
All right, we're all set.

653
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:02,567
All right, let's do it.

654
00:48:20,877 --> 00:48:22,378
Heh.

655
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:33,014
COOPER:
Thirty percent of spin.

656
00:48:39,938 --> 00:48:41,272
One G.

657
00:48:42,024 --> 00:48:44,025
How's gravity treating you back there?

658
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:45,526
Well.

659
00:48:48,697 --> 00:48:50,489
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

660
00:48:50,657 --> 00:48:51,699
- Yeah.
- You all right?

661
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:53,951
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

662
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:57,661
OK, I think we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that

663
00:48:57,761 --> 00:48:59,621
or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec.

664
00:48:59,622 --> 00:49:01,375
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

665
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,544
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

666
00:49:12,012 --> 00:49:14,889
Amelia, be safe.

667
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:18,726
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

668
00:49:18,894 --> 00:49:20,811
It looks good for your trajectory.

669
00:49:20,979 --> 00:49:24,315
We've calculated two years to Saturn.

670
00:49:25,067 --> 00:49:26,567
That's a lot of Dramamine.

671
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:29,737
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

672
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,074
We'll be waiting for you when you get back.

673
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:37,411
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

674
00:49:40,248 --> 00:49:43,584
BRAND:
Do not go gentle into that good night

675
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:48,297
Old age should burn and
rave at close of day

676
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:54,428
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

677
00:49:55,305 --> 00:49:59,100
Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right

678
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:02,311
Because their words had forked
No lightning they

679
00:50:02,729 --> 00:50:06,273
Do not go gentle into that good night

680
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:11,278
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

681
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:29,547
DOYLE: You good?
ROMILLY: Yeah.

682
00:50:30,465 --> 00:50:31,966
Okay, thank you.

683
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,804
Here. Pills.

684
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:40,975
So alone.

685
00:50:41,476 --> 00:50:43,436
We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

686
00:50:43,603 --> 00:50:44,979
No, I mean them.

687
00:50:45,147 --> 00:50:46,272
Hm?

688
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,734
COOPER: it's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

689
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,571
No, it's not like looking for a new condo.

690
00:50:54,698 --> 00:50:56,866
The human race is going to be...

691
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:58,409
adrift...

692
00:50:58,577 --> 00:51:02,079
desperate for a rock it can cling to

They're hardly gentle.

something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

there isn't some way that the probe...

02:38:50,459 --> 02:38:52,084
95 percent.

2056
02:38:52,419 --> 02:38:54,921
Confirmed. Additional customization?

2057
02:38:55,797 --> 02:38:56,923
Humor:

2058
02:38:58,425 --> 02:38:59,926
75 percent.

2059
02:39:00,302 --> 02:39:01,636
Confirmed.

2060
02:39:02,304 --> 02:39:05,431
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...

2061
02:39:05,599 --> 02:39:07,516
Let's make that 60 percent.

2062
02:39:09,811 --> 02:39:11,938
Sixty percent confirmed.

2063
02:39:12,564 --> 02:39:15,650
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

2064
02:39:20,530 --> 02:39:22,657
Is this really what it was like?

2065
02:39:24,868 --> 02:39:27,286
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.

2066
02:39:31,792 --> 02:39:35,461
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

2067
02:39:37,547 --> 02:39:39,840
I want to know where we are.

2068
02:39:41,468 --> 02:39:43,010
Where we're going.

2069
02:39:47,557 --> 02:39:50,643
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

2070
02:39:50,811 --> 02:39:51,894
Family?

2071
02:39:52,062 --> 02:39:55,940
Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's
been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

2072
02:40:12,499 --> 02:40:14,292
[FAMILY EXITS ROOM]

2073
02:40:29,016 --> 02:40:30,891
You told them I like farming.

2074
02:40:31,059 --> 02:40:32,727
[BOTH LAUGH]

2075
02:40:36,857 --> 02:40:38,524
It was me, Murph.

2076
02:40:40,986 --> 02:40:42,778
I was your ghost.

2077
02:40:44,072 --> 02:40:45,698
I know.

2078
02:40:47,492 --> 02:40:52,204
People didn't believe me. They thought
that I was doing it all myself.

2079
02:40:52,372 --> 02:40:53,414
But...

2080
02:40:56,293 --> 02:40:58,252
I knew who it was.

2081
02:41:03,216 --> 02:41:05,384
Nobody believed me.

2082
02:41:05,886 --> 02:41:08,304
But I knew you'd come back.

2083
02:41:10,891 --> 02:41:12,099
How?

2084
02:41:14,102 --> 02:41:17,229
Because my dad promised me.

2085
02:41:23,278 --> 02:41:25,279
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

2086
02:41:26,573 --> 02:41:27,907
I'm here.

2087
02:41:29,368 --> 02:41:30,701
No.

2088
02:41:32,788 --> 02:41:36,916
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

2089
02:41:39,836 --> 02:41:42,505
I have my kids here for me now.

2090
02:41:45,300 --> 02:41:46,801
You go.

2091
02:41:49,721 --> 02:41:51,222
Where?

2092
02:41:54,726 --> 02:41:56,310
Brand.

2093
02:42:06,154 --> 02:42:07,780
MURPH:
She's out there...

2094
02:42:14,204 --> 02:42:15,955
setting up camp.

2095
02:42:42,441 --> 02:42:44,150
Alone...

2096
02:42:45,318 --> 02:42:47,987
in a strange galaxy.

2097
02:42:58,874 --> 02:43:03,544
Maybe right now
she's settling in for the long nap...

2098
02:43:21,897 --> 02:43:24,732
by the light of our new sun...

2099
02:43:40,207 --> 02:43:42,249
in our new home.
